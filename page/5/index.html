New teams were created with the goal of splitting up the logic that was powering the back-end and then bring to life new small services. Then, we started working on what we call <em>Microsites</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Microsites"><a href="#Microsites" class="headerlink" title="Microsites"></a>Microsites</h3><p>A microsite is a very small set of web-pages, or even a single one, that takes care of handling a very specific part of the system’s domain logic. Examples are the <em>Search Results</em> page or the <em>Restaurant’s Profile</em> page. Every microsite is an independently deployable unit of code, so it is easier to test, to deploy, and in consequence more resilient. Microsites are then all connected by a front-door service that handles the routing.</p>
<h3 id="Not-a-free-ride"><a href="#Not-a-free-ride" class="headerlink" title="Not a free ride"></a>Not a free ride</h3><p>When we deployed some microsites to production we immediately discovered a lot of pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bi-weekly deployments of the monolith became hundreds of deployments every week.</li>
<li>Not anymore a shared codebase for hundreds of engineers. Pull requests accepted, merged, and often deployed on the same day.</li>
<li>Teams experimenting and reiterating faster: product was happy.</li>
<li><em>Diversity</em> on tech stacks: teams were finally able to pick their own favourite web-stack, as soon as they were capable of deploying their code and taking care of it in terms of reliability and performance.</li>
<li>Robustness: when something was wrong with a microsite, everything else was fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, we soon realised that we introduced new problems on the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplication: teams started duplicating a lot of code, specifically front-end components such as the header, the footer, etc.</li>
<li>Coordination: when we needed to change something on the header, for example, we were expecting to see the change live in different time frames, resulting in inconsistencies.</li>
<li>Performance: every microsite was hosting its own duplicated css, javascript libraries, and static resources; resulting as a big disadvantage for the end-user in terms of performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="SRS-aka-Site-Resources-Service"><a href="#SRS-aka-Site-Resources-Service" class="headerlink" title="SRS - aka Site Resources Service"></a>SRS - aka Site Resources Service</h3><p>To solve some of these problems we created a REST api to serve html snippets, that soon we started to call <em>components</em>. Main characteristics of the system are:</p></div><a href="/blog/2015/02/09/dismantling-the-monolith-microsites-at-opentable/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/02/02/a-beginners-guide-to-rest-services/"><h2 class="post-title">A Beginner's guide to REST services</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 2 February 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/REST/" class="tag post-meta">REST</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/API/" class="tag post-meta">API</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Architecture/" class="tag post-meta">Architecture</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Engineering/" class="tag post-meta">Engineering</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Theory/" class="tag post-meta">Theory</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Why-this-post"><a href="#Why-this-post" class="headerlink" title="Why this post?"></a>Why this post?</h2><p>As a junior, I always find it easier to just sit and write code than actually stop to think about the theoretical basis that lie under the applications I work on. <strong>REST</strong>  is one of those terms I heard a lot about, so I decided to try to sum up what it means and how it affects the choices we make everyday as software engineers.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction-to-REST"><a href="#Introduction-to-REST" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to REST"></a>Introduction to REST</h2><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it can be defined as an architectural style used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service that is designed by REST principles can be called a <strong>RESTful service</strong>.</p>
<p>It has been described first in 2000 by Roy Fielding, in a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissertation</a> called “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures”. The basic idea was to describe the interactions between the components of a distributed system, putting constraints on them and emphasizing the importance of an uniform interface, that is abstracted from the single components.</p>
<p>REST is often applied to the design and development of web services, which is the scenario I’ll try to address in this post.</p>
<p>The purpose of a web service can be summed up as follows: it exposes <strong>resources</strong> to a <strong>client</strong> so that it can have access to them (examples of typical resources include pictures, video files, web pages and business data).</p>
<p>Common features of a service that is built in a REST style are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representations</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>URIs</li>
<li>Uniform Interface</li>
<li>Statelessness</li>
<li>Links between resources</li>
<li>Caching</li>
</ul>

It allows not only to find out about errors but also quickly identify their cause. Logs are often used to generate metrics that help business and engineering make informative decisions on future development directions. </p>
<p>At OpenTable we have a central logging infrastructure, that means all logs are stored in the same shared database (ElasticSearch for us). And everybody can access any logs they want without having very specialized knowledge (thanks Kibana!).</p>
<p>ElasticSearch, though living in a NoSQL world, is not actually a schema-free database. Sure, you do not need to provide schema to it but instead ES will infer schema for you from documents you send to it. This is very similar to type inference you can find in many programming languages. You do not need to specify type of field, but if you later on try to assign inappropriate value to it you will get an exception.</p>
<p>This trait of our database goes all the way to the root of our logging system design. Let me explain why I say that we have ‘strongly typed logs’.</p>
<h2 id="In-The-Beginning-There-Was-String"><a href="#In-The-Beginning-There-Was-String" class="headerlink" title="In The Beginning There Was String"></a>In The Beginning There Was String</h2><p>Before centralization we just logged a single message along with its importance. In code it looked something like:<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">logger.ERROR(“Kaboom!”)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p></p>
<p>which resulted in logline on disk having timestamp, severity and message.<br></p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;2014-10-10T07:33:04Z [ERROR] Kaboom!&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><a href="/blog/2015/01/23/on-strongly-typed-logging/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/01/19/building-a-living-styleguide-at-opentable/"><h2 class="post-title">Building a living styleguide at OpenTable</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 19 January 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/OpenTable/" class="tag post-meta">OpenTable</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/UI/" class="tag post-meta">UI</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Design/" class="tag post-meta">Design</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/CSS/" class="tag post-meta">CSS</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Styleguide/" class="tag post-meta">Styleguide</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>If you’re reading this you’ve probably built yourself a website.  A site - large or small - that’s thrown together or crafted over many months.  And if you have, you’ve probably kept all your CSS class names in your head, or at least been able to go straight to the relevant stylesheets to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Well OpenTable is unsurprisingly built by many engineering teams across multiple continents, and was completely redesigned last year.  And as soon as you have more than a handful of people working on your front-end you will quickly find a well-intentioned developer causing one or both of these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-intentioned developer adds a new submission form but, like the design Philistine he is, his buttons are <span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:18px;color:#E40000;">18px Verdana #E40000</span>, not the correct <span style="font-family:arial;font-size:16px;color:#DA3743;">16px Arial #DA3743</span></li>
<li>Your good old developer knows which font size and colour it should be, but bungs a duplicate class into a random stylesheet (or worse still, inline)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these risks, a single front-end dev (or a team of them) cannot check every new piece of code or they will quickly become a bottleneck.</p>
<h3 id="You-need-some-guidelines"><a href="#You-need-some-guidelines" class="headerlink" title="You need some guidelines"></a>You need some guidelines</h3><p>Offline designers regularly create ‘brand guidelines’ or ‘design standards’ to document the precise way their brand or product should be recreated when outside of their control.  Online, such guidelines are similarly invaluable for maintaining brand and code consistency with multiple engineers and designers, but it is blindingly obvious that a printed or ‘static’ set of guidelines is completely unsuitable for a constantly changing website.</p>
<p>Step forward a ‘living’ styleguide.</p>
<p>A living styleguide gives a visual representation of a site’s UI elements using <strong>the exact same code</strong> as on the website, in most cases via the live CSS.  A living styleguide may also provide reusable CSS and HTML code examples and they are not just for engineers new to the code; I frequently use ours at OpenTable and I wrote the stylesheets in the first place (I can’t be expected to remember everything).</p>
<p>Providing reusable code improves collaboration, consistency and standards, and reduces design and development time - but like most documentation it is essential your guide is always up-to-date and trustworthy.  So if a living styleguide is (theoretically) always up-to-date, how did we build ours?</p>

It was developed to solve some of the complexities of the MVC pattern when used at scale by favouring a uni-directional approach. It is a pattern and not a technology or framework.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/mvc-scale.png" alt="MVC scale issue"></p>
<p>When applications that use the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern at any scale it becomes difficult to maintain consistent data across multiple views. In particular the case whereby flow between models and views is not uni-directional and may require increasing logic to maintain parity between views when model data is updated. Facebook hit this issue several times and in particular with their unseen count (an incremented value of unseen messages which is updated by several UI chat components). It wasn’t until they realised that the MVC pattern accomodated the complexity that they stepped back from the problem and addressed the architecture.</p>
<p>Flux is intentionally unidirectional.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/flux.png" alt="flux"></p>
<p>Key to this architecture is the dispatcher. The dispatcher forms the gatekeeper that all actions must go through. When a view, or views, wish to do something they fire an action which the dispatcher correctly routes via registered callbacks made by the stores. </p>
<p>Stores are responsible for the data and respond to callbacks from the dispatcher. When data is changed they emit change events that views listen to to notify them that data has changed. The view can then respond accordingly (for example to update/rebind).</p>
<p>This will become more obvious when we go through the macgyver.js example.</p>
