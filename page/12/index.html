Maybe you’ve had the opposite experience and the session ended up being a failure for both of you?</p>
<p>We are fortunate enough to be in an industry that gives us the chance to coach others and have a direct influence on the learning of individuals around us. But how do we know when we’re doing it right, or more importantly what can we do when it starts to go wrong?</p>
<h2 id="Know-your-student-find-their-style"><a href="#Know-your-student-find-their-style" class="headerlink" title="Know your student, find their style"></a>Know your student, find their style</h2><p>Let’s start with the science behind how we learn.</p>
<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experimental Learning</a>‘. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>
<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb’s definition of separate styles was confused. </p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honey and Mumford and their 1999 adaptation on Kolb’s model</a>. They identified four distinct learning styles which have since grown to be the preferred assessment of human learning styles. </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is not all individuals can be pigeon-holed into one group. These characteristics are evident across all industries and teams; I can certainly see myself and others in this list. Can you?</p>
<p>Now we can silo and identify behaviour, we can look deeper into the flow of learning.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/"><h2 class="post-title">Beginning a journey to chatops with Hubot</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 November 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hubot/" class="tag post-meta">Hubot</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hipchat/" class="tag post-meta">Hipchat</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Chatops/" class="tag post-meta">Chatops</a></p><div class="post-entry"><img src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png" class="center">
<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Chatops"><a href="#What-is-Chatops" class="headerlink" title="What is Chatops?"></a>What is Chatops?</h2><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Hubot"><a href="#What-is-Hubot" class="headerlink" title="What is Hubot?"></a>What is Hubot?</h2><p>Hubot is a chat bot that sits in your chat room, listens for commands and executes them. It was written by Github in Coffeescript on Node.js and comes with a host of <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prewritten scripts</a> to get started with. Hubot also comes with a range of adaptors that allow it to plug-in to chat servers such as Campfire, IRC and Hipchat. We chose the latter.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-get-started"><a href="#How-do-you-get-started" class="headerlink" title="How do you get started?"></a>How do you get started?</h2><p>I won’t re-write the readme because the getting started section <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> says it all. Using the node package manager it’s so easy to get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubot</a>. So many other people have documented this process that I won’t attempt to rewrite their <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/writing-hubot-plugins-with-coffeescript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="The-code"><a href="#The-code" class="headerlink" title="The code"></a>The code</h2><p>The meta data that we added to the site are an <em>application ID</em>, and what Microsoft have termed the <em>Package Family name</em>.

&lt;meta name=&quot;msApplication-PackageFamilyName&quot; content=&quot;OpenTable.OpenTable_r44en0zefym0a&quot;/&gt;

<h2 id="Finding-the-values"><a href="#Finding-the-values" class="headerlink" title="Finding the values"></a>Finding the values</h2><p>There are at least two ways of finding the values. If you have your application code and Visual Studio 2012 (or later) then the values can be found in the <strong>package.appxmanifest</strong> file &ndash; open this in VS and it automatically launches the manifest designer view.  Select the Packaging tab and the “Package name” is the _ID_, and the <em>Package family name</em> is at the bottom of this screen.</p>

I wanted to be able to extend this functionality. I wanted to allow different domains to point to different areas. This would allow me to deploy the application just once and then have different headers on the web server rather than regional variances. Whilst on a flight to San Francisco, I was able to hack together some code that allows just that. The details of that hackiness are below.</p>
<p>I started with a simple ASP.NET MVC application. I then created an area. The default area registration looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>public class Domain1AreaRegistration: AreaRegistration   
{
    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            &quot;Domain_1_default&quot;,
            &quot;Domain1/{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            new[] { &quot;WebApplication.Controllers&quot; }
        );
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return &quot;Domain1&quot;; }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The name of the folder in my project corresponds to the AreaName as above. I have approximately six areas in the application that relate to different views. Now is where the hacky magic happens. I build the routing for the application myself. In my global.asax.cs, I have the following declaration:</p>
<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

    //this is done using my IoC container
    var routingEngine = new RoutingEngineFactory();
    routingEngine.RoutingRegistration(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</code></pre><p>This is the creation of my RoutingEngine. This class is responsible for taking each area in the system in turn and then creating the routes for my application based on these. I am sure you are asking why I am doing that? The answer is simply that I can use a combination of MapRoute and IRouteConstraints to build a sufficient route for the URLs I need to map. The code looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>public void RoutingRegistration(RouteCollection routes)
{
    var areaNames = GetAllAreasRegistered(routes);
    routes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}&quot;);
    routes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{*favicon}&quot;, new { favicon = @&quot;(.*/)?favicon.ico(/.*)?&quot; });

    foreach (var area in areaNames.Select(Area.From))
    {
        RegisterDefaultRoute(area.Name, routes);
    }
}

private void RegisterDefaultRoute(string areaName, RouteCollection routes)
{
    var defaultRoute = routes.MapRoute(
            BuildRouteSegment(areaName, &quot;Default&quot;),
            &quot;{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            BuildUrlConstraint(areaName),
            new[] { DefaultControllerNameSpace }
            );
    defaultRoute.SetAreaDataTokens(areaName);
}
</code></pre><p>The code works in the following way:</p>
<p>Get a list of all the areas.<br>Add the Ignore routes as these are more specific and need to be at the top of the list.<br>To this list of areas, add a new area of name string.Empty. This will allow us to register the routes for the non area parts of the site. This is really hacky as denoted by the code above.<br>Foreach area in the list, register a route. This route has the same URL for all routes.<br>But how do we distinguish which of the routes match to a specific domain?</p>
<p>routes.MapRoute in MVC has a number of overloads. The overload we will be using has the following signature:</p></div><a href="/blog/2013/09/25/resolving-domains-to-areas-in-asp-dot-net-mvc/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/09/23/quick-look-at-rethinkdb/"><h2 class="post-title">Quick look at RethinkDB</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 23 September 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/MongoDB/" class="tag post-meta">MongoDB</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/NoSQL/" class="tag post-meta">NoSQL</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/RethinkDB/" class="tag post-meta">RethinkDB</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Someone in the office mentioned <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RethinkDb</a> and I was impressed by the rhetoric on the site, so I decided to spend a couple of hours spiking one of our existing nodejs apps with RethinkDb.

<p><strong>Writes are non-locking operations</strong></p>
<p>A major bugbear for us with mongoDb is that writes require a database-level lock.
