<p>This should be a very straightforward task to complete because this is one of the core resources that Puppet manages - the upgrading of packages. With that in mind, putting <code>package { ‘puppet’: ensure =&gt; $version }</code> in one of our base profiles would be all that was needed but alas it was not. In this blog I want to take you through the history, the bugs, the platforms and the edge-cases that make performing an in-place upgrade of Puppet a more complex task that it ought to be.</p>
<h2 id="Debian"><a href="#Debian" class="headerlink" title="Debian"></a>Debian</h2><p>Like many, Ubuntu is our Debian derivative of choice for much of our newer production infrastructure. Debian, has the apt package management system and PuppetLabs provide the required deb packages as well as hosting their own apt repository to point our systems to. The main point of package management systems is that they take care of the dependency hell and the awkward upgrade paths all from within the confines of the package itself, and that is what happens with the PuppetLabs packages - great. </p>
<p>The problem that we had in some of our systems was that they had been built without the PuppetLabs apt repository. This means that they picked up a slightly older version of the Puppet packages from the main Ubuntu distribution repositories and didn’t have access to the newer versions of the Puppet packages. Ok, so we solved that with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>exec { &apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;:
  path    =&gt; &apos;/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin&apos;,
  command =&gt; &apos;sed -i \&apos;s:deb\ http\:\/\/apt.puppetlabs.com\/ precise main::\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
  onlyif  =&gt; &apos;grep \&apos;deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ precise main\&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&apos;,
}

apt::source { &apos;puppetlabs&apos;:
  location    =&gt; &apos;http://apt.puppetlabs.com&apos;,
  repos       =&gt; &apos;main dependencies&apos;,
  key         =&gt; &apos;4BD6EC30&apos;,
  key_content =&gt; template(&apos;puppetversion/puppetlabs.gpg&apos;),
  require     =&gt; Exec[&apos;rm_duplicate_puppet_source&apos;]
}
</code></pre><p>We’re making use of the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">puppetlabs/apt</a> module here. This removes the old reference and adding in the new apt source. Then we just add the package and ensure the version we’re upgrading. Perfect.</p>
<h2 id="RedHat"><a href="#RedHat" class="headerlink" title="RedHat"></a>RedHat</h2><p>Same problem different OS family - this time we had some older CentOS machines that needed fixing. Thankfully there is also a module <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/puppetlabs_yum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stahnma/puppetlabs_yum</a> for the yum repositories. Add that in, add the package resource and start upgrading. Phew! This seems like it’s getting easier.</p>
<h2 id="Windows"><a href="#Windows" class="headerlink" title="Windows"></a>Windows</h2></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 4 April 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>One afternoon I got asked to write a new Puppet module to manage local users on our Linux boxes. Not a contrived example but a real-world need as we begin to move our infrastructure from Windows to Linux. Managing users is one of those tasks that is at the core of the Puppet ecosystem and I thought this would be pretty easy as I had done this sort of thing many times before. What added to the complexity was that we needed to support Ubuntu, Centos and FreeBSD machines that we had in our stack and we wanted to make it something that was open source and on the Forge - so lots of testing was required.</p>
<p>This was not the first module that I had written for the Forge but it was the first that I had written since PuppetLabs had introduced their new acceptance testing framework <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beaker</a> and so I wanted to spend some time getting the module working with this new tool.</p>
<h2 id="Beaker"><a href="#Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Beaker"></a>Beaker</h2><p>The purpose of Beaker is to allow you to write acceptance tests for your modules, that is to write some manifests that use your module and test them out on a virtual machine. Some of you may remember <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/rspec-system-puppet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rspec-system-puppet</a> was previously used to accomplish this, well PuppetLabs has since deprecated that in favour of Beaker but the premise is very much the same.</p>
<p>Using rspec-puppet for unit testing your manifests really only goes so far. If you’re just using the standard Puppet resources then it pretty safe to assume that it does what it says on the tin (I mean PuppetLabs really test their stuff!) but as soon as you start doing things that are a little more complex, using exec statements, custom facts, custom functions or targeting multiple operating systems then you’re really going to want to make sure that once the catalogs compile that they are doing what they are meant to be doing and this is where your acceptance test suite will come in.</p>
<p>With Beaker you can spin up a virtual machine, install modules, apply a manifest and then test what really happened.</p>
<p>Beaker works with many different hypervisor technologies but most people will be using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vagrant</a> so that is what I will cover here.</p>
<h3 id="Configuring-Beaker"><a href="#Configuring-Beaker" class="headerlink" title="Configuring Beaker"></a>Configuring Beaker</h3><p>The first thing in configuring your existing project to use Beaker is to add “beaker” and “beaker_rspec” to you Gemfile. You’re then going to want to create a new spec_helper file called spec_helper_acceptence.rb that should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>require &apos;beaker-rspec/spec_helper&apos;
require &apos;beaker-rspec/helpers/serverspec&apos;

hosts.each do |host|
  install_puppet
end

UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = [&apos;Suse&apos;,&apos;windows&apos;,&apos;AIX&apos;,&apos;Solaris&apos;]

RSpec.configure do |c|
  proj_root = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), &apos;..&apos;))

  c.formatter = :documentation

  # Configure all nodes in nodeset
  c.before :suite do
    puppet_module_install(:source =&gt; proj_root, :module_name =&gt; &apos;homes&apos;)
    hosts.each do |host|
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;,&apos;install&apos;,&apos;puppetlabs-stdlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
      on host, puppet(&apos;module&apos;, &apos;install&apos;, &apos;opentable-altlib&apos;), { :acceptable_exit_codes =&gt; [0,1] }
    end
  end
end

As part of the infrastructure team at OpenTable we are begining a process of being open-first. That means that everything we write will be open-sourced unless it contains a significant amount of internal information but we will architect to limit this.</p>
<p>As part of that commitment we are trying to release all our Puppet configuration. The key to maintaining any good habit is to do little and often and with that in mind we wanted to let you know about ForgeFriday.</p>
<p>Every Friday we will be releasing our Puppet code onto the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PuppetLabs Forge</a> (until we run out of modules). That means all our Windows modules, all our forks, our experiments, our custom facts and functions - anything and everything will start rolling out on Fridays. </p>
<p>It’s not just forge and forget either, we will continue to support all of our modules and those that use them. We will blog about some of the bigger, more important ones and continue to engage with the community as much as possible. If you’re using our modules (even if you have no issues) then let us know - we’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>In the meantime go and check out what we have already released:</p>
<p><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/windowsfeature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opentable/windowsfeature</a> - Module that will turn Windows features on or off<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/iis_rewrite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opentable/iis_rewrite</a> - Module that will install the IIS Rewrite 2.0 Module on Windows <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/remaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opentable/remaster</a> - Module for managing the remaster of agent nodes <br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/puppetversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opentable/puppetversion</a> - Module for managing the installation and upgrade of Puppet<br><br><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable/altlib" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opentable/altlib</a> - Module providing some additional useful functions <br></p>

It can be taken for granted and tacked on using nasty query string values. But thankfully HTTP provides us with a solid gold opportunity. If you can look past the mire of content negotiation you can see the nuggets that lie inside.</p>
<p>The accept-language header is used by most browsers and allows websites to serve content in a language that the user can (hopefully) understand. When we expose content from an api (in most of our use cases, at least), this content eventually ends up in front of a human (in some shape or form). Having our service-service communication serve localised resources can be invaluable because it frees the clients from having to think about i18n of the resources being served from our api.</p>
<p>It is a simple part of the HTTP specification and is widely used and supported.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /product/123</span><br><span class="line">Accept-Language: en-US</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The accept-language header is specifically designed to allow the server to provide a representation of the resource which approximates something the client can understand.</p>
<p>The really useful bit comes from the quality value. </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /product/123</span><br><span class="line">Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This header asks the service to provide en-US, and if it’s unavailable then fall back to <strong>any</strong> english representation. The quality value (<code>q=0.8</code>) is a decimal value between 0 and 1 which indicates order of preference when specifying multiple languages. The server should pick the <strong>first</strong> available match. If there are multiple matches with the same quality value, then the server can pick any. If the client wants to specify some fierce preferences then they can crank out something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /product/123</span><br><span class="line">Accept-Language: fr-CA,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en;q=0.2,*;q=0.1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>If you decipher this it’s pretty simple, you can see the quality headers giving the order in which the languages are preferred. What it does is give the client fantastic flexibility. For service-service communication you might have a use-case which will <em>never</em> serve a representation that doesn’t match the request, or you might need to <em>always</em> provide some representation (i.e. for cases where some content is always better than none).</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/04/02/internationalisation-in-a-restful-world/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/03/20/when-to-performance-test-in-production/"><h2 class="post-title">When to performance test in production</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 20 March 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Performance/" class="tag post-meta">Performance</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/03/19/performance-testing-our-search-api/">my last post</a> about performance testing I wrote about how we decided to do it in production as the ultimate test of success. Performance testing in production is enough to make some operations guys have a panic attack and a few odd looks were dished my way when I raised it on behalf of the team.</p>
<h2 id="Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment"><a href="#Why-not-have-a-dedicated-environment" class="headerlink" title="Why not have a dedicated environment?"></a>Why not have a dedicated environment?</h2><p>If you can have a dedicated environment that you can build to be EXACTLY the same as where you are going to really need the performance (i.e. your production environment most likely, but possibly on a client machine) then do it in a dedicated, duplicated environment. Alternatively if there is no way you can use the production environment or your model means that everything will scale exactly like production, then a duplicate environment might work.</p>
<p>For us, we had too many dependencies, mocking these out wasn’t really satisfactory and frankly, as a business where we are quiet at night, it is easy to use the production environment at these times. We use configuration management and virtual machines, much of what should help build a replica environment, but we also have machines in restaurants around the globe. That is not easy to replicate and not worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you"><a href="#Even-if-you-can-have-a-duplicated-environment-should-you" class="headerlink" title="Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?"></a>Even if you can have a duplicated environment should you?</h2><p>We felt in the search team that we just wouldn’t uncover a broken server (that can affect performance) or we wouldn’t see that we had a problem with interactions with these services (we have now got to serialisation as our bottleneck, maybe we would have missed that).</p>
<p>We just didn’t trust that a duplicated environment would actually help us in this case. If you want to test a new idea as a prototype then the duplicate will probably work, even if just at first, we were trying to improve our actual environment.</p>
<h2 id="Is-testing-in-production-right"><a href="#Is-testing-in-production-right" class="headerlink" title="Is testing in production right?"></a>Is testing in production right?</h2><p>There is no ‘right’ answer here, plenty of people test in a duplicate environment and then monitor in production. I think this is probably a valid approach and in a lot of use cases this would be fine for us too.</p>
<p>Can you micro-optimise in a huge production system?  Probably not, so use a scaled down duplicate for that or even a local environment such as one created using Vagrant. Hopefully with enough micro-optimisations you will eventually see these in a larger environment.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/03/20/when-to-performance-test-in-production/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article></div><ul class="pager main-pager"><li class="previous"><a href="/page/9">← Newer Posts</a></li><li class="next"><a href="/page/11">Older Posts →</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container beautiful-jekyll-footer"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/opentable" title="GitHub"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-github"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk" title="Twitter"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-twitter"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/12181" title="LinkedIn"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-linkedin"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/opentable" title="StackOverflow"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-stack-overflow"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-muted">© OpenTable • 2022 • <a href="mailto:undefined"></a>
