After a few months of intensive TDD and SOLID training at OpenTable I was curious how those principles apply in a slightly different environment. Guess what, they do not differ that much… I planned to write about all this sometime in the future after gaining more experience from real battles ahead, however <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2013/02/09/why-i-dont-like-Jasmine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watirmelon post</a> invited me to attack this subject immediately.</p>
<p>I went through the available testing frameworks for Javascript and decided on Jasmine. Why? Mainly because of its BDD syntax which is fashionable this season. The second reason is that it has really cool documentation. Finally, the basic set up of just running an HTML file in a browser got me up and running fast.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the basics - what I expect from different types of tests and how Jasmine fits into those requirements: </p>
<h2 id="Unit-Testing"><a href="#Unit-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Unit Testing"></a>Unit Testing</h2><h3 id="Advice-from-senior-craftsman"><a href="#Advice-from-senior-craftsman" class="headerlink" title="Advice from senior craftsman"></a>Advice from senior craftsman</h3><ul>
<li>Shoot them one by one<br>(structure your code so that it is easier to maintain)</li>
<li>Be sure you kill with every shot<br>(verify small bits of code to nail down issues)</li>
<li>Kill them all<br>(verify edge cases)</li>
<li>Kill them quick<br>(provide fast feedback on issues)</li>
<li>Choose a fast shooting gun - the faster you shoot, the more enemies you will kill<br>(unit tests must be blazing fast)</li>
<li>Choose the most reliable gun - if it is stuck then you are dead<br>(when unit tests are brittle you will stop depending on them)</li>
<li>Your gun needs to be light enough to carry everywhere<br>(unit tests are your gun, so you must be able to run them all locally)</li>
</ul>
<p>Jasmine works great for all those aims, as it is really fast and it allows you to stub both objects and DOM elements (especially combined with a Jasmine-jQuery plugin). Keep in mind that Unit Testing is useful only if you either write new code or refactor old code. Do not ever try to write Unit Tests for existing code which you don’t intend to refactor. It’s like shooting the dead. You simply cannot kill them with another bullet.</p>

<li>Beware of the hidden sniper<br>(test against external dependencies like files, databases, network services)</li>
<li>You are part of your squad<br>(verify that components of the application work well together)</li>
<li>Observe the environment<br>(try to use depenedencies as close to the real problem as possible e.g. example file, database with test data, test version of an external service)</li>
<li>Point in the right direction<br>(do not try to test your stack top-down, instead concentrate on interfaces and adapters that you could not test in unit tests)</li>

There is no easy way to do it. The general way to install a certificate to a Windows Server 2008 machine is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Certificates snap-in for a user, computer, or service.</li>
<li>In the console tree, click the logical store where you want to import the certificate.</li>
<li>On the Action menu, point to All Tasks, and then click Import to start the Certificate Import Wizard.</li>
<li>Type the file name containing the certificate to be imported. </li>
<li>If you want to specify where the certificate is stored, select Place all certificates in the following store, click Browse, and choose the certificate store to use. OR</li>
<li>If the certificate should be automatically placed in a certificate store based on the type of certificate, click Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time I ran this process, I felt as though this was just wrong to not be able to automate. The goal of our team is to automate everything we are currently doing manually. PowerShell is a better option for this import process as it allows you to write code to do it. As we all know, code is better for a number of reasons, I won’t go into the infrastructure as code argument in this post (but it is coming soon….). Using PowerShell, I can write a simple function as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function Import-PfxCertificate($certName, $CertLocaton, $certRootStore, $certStore) {    
     $pfx = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2    

     $pfxPass = convertto-securestring $CertPassword -asplaintext -force

     $certPath = $CertLocaton + &quot;\&quot; + $certName   
     $pfx.import($certPath,$pfxPass,&quot;Exportable,PersistKeySet&quot;)    

     $store = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store($certStore,$certRootStore)    
     $store.open(&quot;MaxAllowed&quot;)    
     $store.add($pfx)    
     $store.close()    
}
</code></pre><p>This makes certificate management easier. To manage certificates in this way, I just need to invoke a script similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>.\import-certificate.ps1 -CertificateName &quot;mycert.pfx&quot; -CertLocation &quot;c:\ssl\mycerts&quot;
</code></pre><p>Much simpler! You can download a <a href="https://gist.github.com/opentable-devops/5951108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gist</a> of this script should you wish to use it.

For two of us it was our first major conference and for one, Paul Stack, he had to speak.</p>
<p>Personally, as my first large, multi-discipline conference, I didn’t really know what to expect. Being away from the team for three days in a foreign country with major project work going on at the same time was a bit uncomfortable. I was worried that the time and expense needed to be justified. That fear went away after the first night in the bar!</p>
<p>The sessions were great, many things I haven’t had a chance to investigate were covered, things like Functional Programming, the latest JavaScript frameworks and tooling. There were also sessions covering things I am more involved with, Agile Process, SOA &amp; Rest, Team Structure and Hiring.</p>
<p>There are other posts around about the individual sessions but I am now much more enthusiastic about functional programming particularly how we could use it and getting back into front end development (even if just in my own time).</p>
<p>The main thing I enjoyed and learnt though is meeting the other delegates. I think staying away from home makes this much more prevalent, something to consider for other conferences. Meeting people at all levels or experience and especially the speakers, most of whom are very generous with their time and ideas, teaches you the most. I probably learnt more over the shuffle board of The Dubliner Pub than reading blog post online in a year (that may be a stretch, but I did learn I was by far the best player on the night). </p>
<p>Watching a colleague speak was also interesting, when you work with a buffoon, however passionate and hard working, to see people actually interested in what he has to say is an eye opener. It makes you realise what you are doing and all its challenges are a step forwards and one to keep pursuing. It also makes you think, “if he can do it, I must be able to, what knowledge should I share?”. What to share is the hard bit.</p>
<p>My final point is how often I should try to get to these; one a year for sure, any more than that? I need to think that through.</p>
<p>Thanks to the organisers of the conference for a well organised, varied and enjoyable time. And if you have project work on, the wifi was excellent so you need never be too far away from the rest of the team, just do it.</p>

Long gone are the days of developers creating runbooks in Word and giving them to our operations team to use to set up our production servers. </p>
<p>When building our webservers on Windows, in order to install / activate Windows features, this was the general set of instructions that was needed to be followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start Button</li>
<li>Click on Control Panel</li>
<li>Click on Programs</li>
<li>Click on Turn Windows features on or off</li>
</ul>
<p>This would present a screen as follows:</p>
<img src="/images/posts/windowsfeature.png" class="center">
<p>You would need to find the correct features to enable and check the box, press OK and then wait for the features to be installed. </p>
<p>When Microsoft introduced Windows Server 2008 and PowerShell 2.0, they also introducted the module ‘ServerManager’. This is a module that allows us to interact, with PowerShell, Windows Features using a range of cmdlets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get-WindowsFeature</li>
<li>Add-WindowsFeature</li>
<li>Remove-WindowsFeature</li>
</ul>
<p>This meant that instead of creating runbooks in Word, our developers could create automation scripts that would take a base Windows Server 2008 server and enable all the Windows Features needed to run our applications. This allowed our operations team to move much faster in configuring our servers. </p>
<p>To turn on the ASP.NET Application Development features in Windows, we would run the following script from PowerShell:</p></div><a href="/blog/2013/06/14/windows-feature-management-with-powershell/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/06/07/nlocalgeocoder/"><h2 class="post-title">nLocalGeoCoder</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 7 June 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/OSS/" class="tag post-meta">OSS</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Net/" class="tag post-meta">.Net</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/C/" class="tag post-meta">C#</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Ruby/" class="tag post-meta">Ruby</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Collaboration/" class="tag post-meta">Collaboration</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>With OpenTable having engineering teams spread across multiple offices it’s important for us to maintain open email dialogue about new products us or our teams have created, new tools we’ve discovered or problem solving approaches that have helped us achieve our goals.  Recently in one of these emails Aish introduced the team to a new open source ruby implementation of reverse geocode lookup for latitude and longitude he’d written called <a href="https://github.com/aishfenton/local-geocoder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local-geocoder</a>.  With an interest in understanding how this worked, to learn a bit of ruby, to make this project accessible to .net developers and just to see how long it would take I decided to port it to C# and .net.</p>
<h2 id="How-reverse-geocoding-works"><a href="#How-reverse-geocoding-works" class="headerlink" title="How reverse geocoding works"></a>How reverse geocoding works</h2><p>Latitude and longitude geographical coordinates are great but 37.819548,-122.479046 doesn’t really mean much to me. Knowing this is in the San Francisco bay area is much more useful interpretation.</p>
<p>That’s where reverse geocoding comes in.  Normally geocoding tries to locate geographical coordinates from other data like postal (zip) codes or street level addresses.  Reverse geocoding does the opposite and can, given enough lookup data, be very precise.</p>
<p>There are a number of online reverse geocoding providers, like Google, who can perform this for you however there are normally usage limits or costs for using them.  To add to this the latency of these service can slow your logic down.  Wouldn’t it be nice if this could be done locally at high speed and in memory.</p>
<h2 id="Using-nLocalGeocoder"><a href="#Using-nLocalGeocoder" class="headerlink" title="Using nLocalGeocoder"></a>Using nLocalGeocoder</h2><p>It’s really easy to use, just new up a Geocoder and you’re off…</p>
<pre><code>var geocoder = new Geocoder();
var result = geocoder.ReverseGeocode(-122.479046M, 37.819548M);
</code></pre><p>The result variable now holds an instance of the Result struct.  This type has the following properties:-</p></div><a href="/blog/2013/06/07/nlocalgeocoder/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article></div><ul class="pager main-pager"><li class="previous"><a href="/page/13">← Newer Posts</a></li><li class="next"><a href="/page/15">Older Posts →</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container beautiful-jekyll-footer"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/opentable" title="GitHub"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-github"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk" title="Twitter"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-twitter"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/12181" title="LinkedIn"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-linkedin"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/opentable" title="StackOverflow"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-stack-overflow"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-muted">© OpenTable • 2022 • <a href="mailto:undefined"></a>
