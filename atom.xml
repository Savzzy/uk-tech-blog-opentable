This is a shorter post that discusses an approach to structuring your project that should make it easier to test and develop.</p><p>Oh and there are lots of code samples again!</p><h2 id="Where-we-left-off"><a href="#Where-we-left-off" class="headerlink" title="Where we left off"></a>Where we left off</h2><p>In my previous post I described how to get a truly isolated in-memory instance of a ASP.NET Core API configured in a test harness to perform repeatable tests. We created an InMemoryStartup class (for configuring the site for testing) and an InMemoryApi class (for encapsulating Test Doubles and setting up the API). I did not go into detail about the content of either of the Start up classes which is what I intend to address here.</p><p>Much of the complexity from this kind of testing derives from having to maintain two configuration classes and keeping them in sync correctly. It is all too easy for strange bugs to creep in and go unnoticed when differences are not correctly replicated. </p><p>The solution to this is actually quite straightforward which is to create shared configuration classes that can be specialised for your in-memory testing situation. My solution involves creating two configuration classes, one for each of the two methods that are implemented by convention in your regular Startup.cs and the two methods of the IStartup interface. These are:</p><ul><li>WebAppConfigurator - for the Configure method of Startup</li><li>ServiceCollectionInstallerRunner - for the ConfigureServices method of Startup</li></ul><p>Both of these classes will have in-memory versions of themselves implemented as extension classes - we will come on to this later. </p><h2 id="WebAppConfigurator"><a href="#WebAppConfigurator" class="headerlink" title="WebAppConfigurator"></a>WebAppConfigurator</h2><p>I know, not the best name but it describes what we are doing here and it’s hard to name configuration and boot strapping classes properly. This class will look roughly as follows</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">WebAppConfigurator</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">private</span> IConfiguration Configuration &#123;

The number of parameters you define in your Startup.Configure() method is flexible depending on what you require for your configuration. In my particular case I required all of the listed parameters. This caused some difficulties when implementing the IStartup interface whose Configure method only takes an IApplicationBuilder.</p><p>The next step is to create an in-memory version of the WebAppConfigurator which derives from the WebAppConfigurator. It will then override implementations of any virtual methods in this class which we use to encapsulate configuration steps.</p><p>This would look as follows:</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">InMemoryWebAppConfigurator</span> : <span class="title">WebAppConfigurator</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="title">InMemoryWebAppConfigurator</span>(<span class="params">IConfiguration configuration</span>) : <span class="title">base</span>(<span class="params">configuration</span>)</span> &#123; &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">protected</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ConfigureSwagger</span>(<span class="params">IApplicationBuilder app</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">protected</span> <span class="keyword">override</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ConfigureLogger</span>(<span class="params">IApplicationBuilder app, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory, IServiceProvider serviceProvider</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In this example we don’t really want swagger running in the test harness nor do we want logging (which in our case is writing to Redis) and so the configuration methods do nothing.

In ASP.NET WebApi I tended to leverage 3rd party dependency injection containers such as Castle Windsor, but in ASP.NET Core I find the built-in resolver works perfectly well; at least with a few additions. </p><p>The first of these I would recommend you use is <a href="https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrutor</a>. This provides two extension methods to the IServiceCollection type; Scan and Decorate. Scan allows you to use convention-based registration, meaning you don’t have to register each type individually. Decorate allows for type decoration. </p><p>The second addition is actually something that you can easily add yourself by copying the code below.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br><span class="line">46</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title">IServiceCollectionInstaller</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ConfigureService</span>(<span class="params">IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration</span>)</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ServiceCollectionInstallerRunner</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ConfigureServices</span>(<span class="params">IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">var</span> installers = GetServiceInstallers();</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">foreach</span> (IServiceCollectionInstaller installer <span class="keyword">in</span> installers)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            installer.ConfigureService(services, configuration);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">protected</span> <span class="keyword">virtual</span> IEnumerable&lt;IServiceCollectionInstaller&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="TL-DR"><a href="#TL-DR" class="headerlink" title="TL;DR"></a>TL;DR</h2><p>This is long post that describes how to setup an in-memory test harness for testing an entire ASP.NET Core API with lots of code examples. </p><h2 id="Testing-and-broccoli"><a href="#Testing-and-broccoli" class="headerlink" title="Testing and broccoli"></a>Testing and broccoli</h2><p>Unit testing, like broccoli, is something we all know we should do, but actually we just want to tuck into the meat and potatoes of production code. One reason you might resist writing unit tests is that you are writing an API which is mostly a CRUD layer over a database (where most of the code is right-to-left copying from a DTO to an API response), or you are writing framework plugins for which you just can’t write meaningful tests (for instance ActionFilters or Binder). </p><p>Well I understand, I’ve been in the same situation, but I have a way of dealing with this problem. What I prefer to do is test at the level of http all the way through the API to the database. But wait, you may cry, that’s not a unit test! Well yes you have a point there, I’m touching lots of different classes when I test like this. I would argue however that the word “unit” is a bit ambiguous; my definition of unit is not ‘a single class’. </p><p>I prefer to classify tests as either <strong>Isolated</strong>, <strong>Integration</strong>, or <strong>End-to-End</strong>. When I say isolated, what I mean is that the test can be run without worrying about external dependencies, whether they are your databases or an external API or other system. This means you can test anything from a single class up to the whole API, reliably and repeatably. Integration tests then focus on integrations with your database, external APIs etc. These tests are simple and limited in scope so when they break your integration code is broken or the system is down. End-to-End tests end up being more akin to smoke tests or sanity tests and any break in these should be reflected in your Isolated and Integration tests. </p><p>Given these definitions let’s look at how you can test your API end-to-end in an isolated fashion. Or put another way, let’s cook that broccoli in butter and chilli and season with salt, pepper and a little grated parmesan (you’re welcome!)</p><p>In order to test an ASP.NET Core application we need to be able to spin up our whole application in a test harness (i.e. your unit test/test fixture). Microsoft provide a NuGet package that lets us do just that; <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost</a> contains a class called TestServer. Once you create an instance of the TestServer you can get an instance of a HttpClient with which you can then make http calls to your API. </p><h2 id="Creating-a-TestServer-instance"><a href="#Creating-a-TestServer-instance" class="headerlink" title="Creating a TestServer instance"></a>Creating a TestServer instance</h2><p>To create an instance of the TestServer you need to supply its constructor with an instance of a WebHostBuilder. The easiest way to create a WebHostBuilder is in the same manner as you would when you are building your IWebHost implementation to run your site with Kestrel.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">Program</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">Main</span>(<span class="params"><span class="keyword">string</span>[] args</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        BuildWebHost(args).Run();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">private</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> IWebHost <span class="title">BuildWebHost</span>(<span class="params"><span class="keyword">string</span>[] args</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> WebHostBuilder().UseKestrel()</span><br><span class="line">            .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())</span><br><span class="line">            .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;()</span><br><span class="line">            .UseUrls(<span class="string">"http://*:"</span> + ApplicationInfoProvider.GetPort())</span><br><span class="line">            .Build();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So in a test harness you would write</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> webHostBuilder = <span class="keyword">new</span> WebHostBuilder().UseStartUp&lt;Startup&gt;());</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> server = <span class="keyword">new</span> TestServer(webHostBuilder);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> httpClient = server.CreateClient();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The problem with this is if you just use your Startup class that you use for normally spinning up your site, you end up with the exact same configuration and therefore the same dependencies. You may think to create a new version of Startup (InMemoryStartup for instance) and reference that; the problem then is that you don’t have an easy way to manipulate the state of your API from your test harness, unless you want to use static properties. That might work in simple cases, but with complex systems managing that static state might become problematic - and who likes statics anyway. </p><p>What we really want to do is pass on instance of a Startup class (designed for in-memory testing) to the WebHostBuilder constructor, but there is no native support for this. To get around this use the following extension method.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">WebHostBuilderExtensions</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> IWebHostBuilder <span class="title">UseStartupInstance</span>(<span class="params"><span class="keyword">this</span> IWebHostBuilder hostBuilder, IStartup startup</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">string</span> name = startup.GetType().GetTypeInfo().Assembly.GetName().Name;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> hostBuilder.UseSetting(WebHostDefaults.ApplicationKey, name).ConfigureServices((services =&gt;</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="keyword">typeof</span>(IStartup).GetTypeInfo().IsAssignableFrom(startup.GetType().GetTypeInfo()))</span><br><span class="line">                services.AddSingleton(startup);</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">else</span></span><br><span class="line">                services.AddSingleton(<span class="keyword">typeof</span>(IStartup), serviceProvider =&gt;</span><br><span class="line">                &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                    IHostingEnvironment requiredService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;IHostingEnvironment&gt;();</span><br><span class="line">                    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> ConventionBasedStartup(StartupLoader.LoadMethods(serviceProvider, startup.GetType(), requiredService.EnvironmentName));</span><br><span class="line">                &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;));</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><blockquote><p>As an aside, this post <a href="https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/aspnet-core-anatomy-how-does-usestartup-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/aspnet-core-anatomy-how-does-usestartup-work</a> is a very in depth look at how Startup classes work in Asp.net.</p></blockquote><p>You might have noticed the IStartUp type in the UseStartupInstance above and be thinking, wait, my Startup class doesn’t implement that, what’s going on? Well, it’s basically some convention-based magic which is explained and examined in the blog post I reference above. It’s the kind of thing that personally irritates me as it makes things less discoverable for the sake of not writing <code>&quot; : IStartup&quot;</code> for each project (This isn’t really why its done but thats what it feels like). </p><p>We can now inject a Startup class as shown below.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> webHostBuilder = <span class="keyword">new</span> WebHostBuilder().UseStartupInstance(<span class="keyword">new</span> Startup());</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> server = <span class="keyword">new</span> TestServer(webHostBuilder);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> httpClient = server.CreateClient();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>But now this won’t work because your normal Startup class does not implement IStartup, therefore we need to create an InMemoryStartup class that does implement this, and which we can customize for testing purposes.

testing an API inside your test harness. The HttpClient provides convenience methods for GET, POST, PUT PATCH and DELETE and also a general SendAsync method that allows for fine grained control. </p><p>What I’ve described here isn’t much more interesting or detailed than what is already described in similar posts. And like all of them so far we have skipped over an important detail; what about databases or any other external service on which I depend? If I simply replicate my application startup logic, I’m still pointing at a real database. This will prevent the tests from being repeatable and reliable as the external database is outside the control of the test harness.</p><p>To get around this we will need to design our InMemoryStartup class to inject Test Doubles (you might refer to them as Mocks, see <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for definitions) into the application in place of your abstractions around your external dependencies (and I assume you are doing this right).</p><p>The place to do this is in the ConfigureServices method where we are setting up our dependency injection container with our dependencies. We would also want to be able to pass in our Test Doubles from our test harness so that the test can control these doubles and also read data from them. The InMemoryStartup class would end up looking something like this.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

All of your usual techniques for creating a common test context can be used to further reduce duplicate setup code. You can also use libraries such as <a href="http://nmock.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMock</a> or <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSubstitute</a> for creating your test doubles instead of hand-rolling them as is my preference. </p><p>You may at this point be thinking there is a risk of inconsistency between the API when it is running against your Startup class and your InMemoryStartup, as these both need to be very similar but also different enough to allow for testing. There are approaches to reduce this risk to a minimum which I plan to cover in a follow-up post as this one has already gone on for long enough.</p><p>I hope this was useful for you and had enough depth to get you started with this style of in memory API testing. </p>]]></content>

    <updated>2022-05-13T19:21:14.166Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago I was asked to give a talk to programming undergraduates at Kings College, London. I wrote up the session as a blog post and added it to my personal website, where it has received <del>thousands</del> one or two hits since.</p><p>Reading it back this week I was pleasantly surprised how relevant and useful it still is, and as <a href="http://bit.ly/2IZpIRr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we are currently hiring engineers</a> at the start of their career it is worth resharing here. </p><h2 id="Getting-that-first-job"><a href="#Getting-that-first-job" class="headerlink" title="Getting that first job"></a>Getting that first job</h2><p>Whilst I can still remember the interview for my first job, I have greater insight these days from interviewing developers, and I have personally recruited, managed and mentored a number of junior engineers at the beginning of their careers. The next sections talk about our hiring process at OpenTable and within this framework here’s how you’d get us to give you a job.</p><h3 id="The-CV"><a href="#The-CV" class="headerlink" title="The CV"></a>The CV</h3><p>The CV is not as crucial as you might think. Get the basics right – no typos and a neat layout – but don’t cram it full of everything you’ve ever done, just enough to whet our appetite. A single page is usually best (no more than two).</p><p>The most important thing for a job as a developer is to show that you love writing code. Nothing conveys this passion better than sites/plugins/projects/online courses that you have worked on, particularly outside of your employment. Even better, provide links to repositories, websites, blogs or Q&amp;A sites to show your work and genuine interest.</p><p>Dare I say it, but your exams results do not really matter to us. Passion, backed up with examples of work will grab our attention, with that hard-earned first or 2:1 counting only as a tie-breaker.</p><h3 id="The-code-test"><a href="#The-code-test" class="headerlink" title="The code test"></a>The code test</h3><p>If we like your CV we’ll ring you for a quick chat, and then ask you to complete a test - either at our office or in your own time. The coding test will vary from role-to-role but will need skills that will be required in the job. If you can’t do the test at all then this isn’t the right role for you, but if you can do part of it then give it a go as it will give us things to talk about in the next stage of the interview.</p><h3 id="The-face-to-face-interview"><a href="#The-face-to-face-interview" class="headerlink" title="The face-to-face interview"></a>The face-to-face interview</h3><p>If there’s enough potential in your test we’ll invite you for an interview. It is daunting, but we like to talk with you for two to three hours to make sure you’re right for the role and that the role is right for you.</p><p>The first half hour will be a code review of your test in which we’ll get you to explain how you completed the exercise and we’ll pair with you to refactor or modify the test’s functionality. We’ll be impressed at this stage if you’ve looked again at your code before the interview and can confidently justify your programming decisions. Even if you couldn’t do half the things required in the test, you stand a good chance if you’re knowledgeable about the sections you did complete.</p><p>For the next 30-60 minutes we’ll conduct a technical interview. You’ll be interviewed by people whose skills overlap with yours and we’re looking for both a general programming understanding and a couple of subjects in which you can speak more deeply. If you don’t think you’re going to be asked about your favourite subjects try and drop them into the conversation. <em>“Do you work with xxx because I’m really interested in that?”</em> will grab our attention and prompt us to ask more.</p><p>The next 40-60 minutes will be a “cultural” interview in which we want to get to know you as a person, how you like to develop code and your understanding of the software development lifecycle. Even if you’ve never written code professionally try and convey passion and a genuine interest and you’ll impress us. A sense of humour is always welcome.</p><p>Finally we’ll ask you to spend some time with the head of engineering in London. This is hopefully the most relaxed time in the process. If you’re good enough to make us want to meet you you’ll definitely have other companies knocking on your door so we’ll try and convince you that OpenTable is a great place to work and assess whether it is the right place for you. We encourage candidate questions throughout the day but this is the best time to have a genuine chat.</p><h2 id="The-first-year-or-two-in-the-job"><a href="#The-first-year-or-two-in-the-job" class="headerlink" title="The first year or two in the job"></a>The first year or two in the job</h2><p>Congratulations, you’ve got your first job. What now? Now, you simply carry on learning (and get paid for it).</p><p>You won’t know a fraction of what the job involves, but in software development no one can know everything. Not even search engines know it all and this is where you will spend a lot of your time. Vastly experienced developers still have to google the answers to things, but when you start out you’ll be doing this a great deal – and that’s absolutely fine.</p><p>If you have the drive to solve problems and know how to look up answers then you’re in the right career. Never be embarrassed to teach yourself as you go. Trial and error will be your default technique and you’ll probably repeat the same mistakes more than once. Software development is constantly changing but if you’re always learning then you’ll be successful.</p><p>If you want to try something new in your job don’t ask permission, just give it a go. Unless it could affect the company’s bottom line, most mistakes are forgivable and you’ll learn your lessons. Just don’t be reckless.</p><p>Get active in the developer community. There are hundreds of free and inexpensive meet-ups and conferences. Be talkative with the people you meet – you’ll learn from them and get to hear about projects or jobs that could be perfect for you. Don’t be self-conscious, and ask as many questions as you can. You’ll find this much easier earlier in your career before you’re too embarrassed because you feel you should already know.</p><h2 id="Things-to-consider-as-you-progress"><a href="#Things-to-consider-as-you-progress" class="headerlink" title="Things to consider as you progress"></a>Things to consider as you progress</h2><p>You’ll hopefully love the company you work for, but only stay with them if you’re genuinely still learning. Job hunting is hard and it’s easy to pretend your current job is just fine – especially if you like your colleagues – but be honest with yourself about your situation to keep progressing.</p><p>Don’t feel like you have to go into management. I’m a manager now and describe my job as “talking to people” – but if this isn’t for you then find a company that nurtures individual contributors. You can still become very senior in the industry as a Principle Engineer or Architect, with little or no people management required.</p><p>Finally do your best to build a good relationship with your manager. This starts with being reliable and prepared, but take it to the next level by understanding what are your manager’s biggest problems and frustrations, and do what you can to solve them. If you struggle to communicate with your manager then identify someone with whom they have a good relationship, analyse why and emulate this. Try to understand the business strategy and identify opportunities and threats.</p><p>A proactive, reliable employee who understands their manager will get the interesting projects and rapid career progression.</p><h2 id="In-summary"><a href="#In-summary" class="headerlink" title="In summary"></a>In summary</h2><ul><li>Start building things straightaway</li><li>Be passionate in your interview</li><li>Embrace trial and error, don’t be afraid to make mistakes</li><li>Get involved in the developer community</li><li>Don’t stay too long in a job in which you’re not learning</li><li>Get on the same wavelength as your manager for good, long-term prospects</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A monad is any type construct that follows a specific pattern; it works in the same way as other design patterns. The .NET <code>ApplicationContext</code> is a <code>singleton</code> in the same way that <code>Array</code> is a <code>Monad</code>. Something being a monad does not define its purpose; in the same way that a <code>class</code> can implement many interfaces, a monadic type can also conform to many patterns to increase its usefulness.</p><p>Monads are hard to get our heads around because they are very generic. They are defined by having two methods: the <code>bind</code> method (also commonly called <code>fmap</code>), and the <code>unit</code> method (also commonly known as <code>pure</code> or <code>from</code>).</p><h2 id="A-bind-fmap-method"><a href="#A-bind-fmap-method" class="headerlink" title="A bind/fmap method."></a>A <code>bind</code>/<code>fmap</code> method.</h2><p>The fmap method follows this signature:<br><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Given a monadic type TMonad with value type V1,</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// and a method that takes a value of type V1 and </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// returns the same monadic type TMonad but with </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// a value type of V2, produce a monadic type </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// TMonad with value V2.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">TMonad&lt;V1&gt; m, Func&lt;V1, TMonad&lt;V2&gt;&gt; f</span>) =&gt; <span class="title">TMonad</span>&lt;<span class="title">V2</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>A quick breakdown of the method signature in plain english: <em>given a monadic type <code>TMonad</code> with value type <code>V1</code>, followed by a method that takes a value of type <code>V1</code> and returns the <strong>same</strong> monadic type <code>TMonad</code> but with a value type of <code>V2</code>, produce a monadic type <code>TMonad</code> with value <code>V2</code>.</em></p><p>From the signature, it appears that we should give the value V1 from the first monad to the function <code>f</code> and simply return the TMonad from that call. The ability to control the usage of that function and the ability to intercept the return value is where it gets interesting.</p><p>The resulting monad will usually be a composition of the original monad, and the new monad produced by <code>f</code>. That means the “state” held by the two monads are <code>merged</code> and the specifics of how is up to the developer.</p><p><em>The monadic type <code>TMonad</code> cannot change after a call to <code>f</code>; a <code>Maybe</code> monad cannot change to a <code>State</code> monad, but this also means that a <code>Maybe</code> monad can never read the value of a <code>State</code> monad by being bound to it. This is something I understood later when I started to question how to use different monads together.</em></p><p><em>The value type <code>V1</code> is free to change as a result of calling <code>f</code>. This is why we denote the final result as <code>TMonad&lt;V2&gt;</code>; this doesn’t prevent the value staying the same, in the same way that in a program, <code>x</code> can equal <code>1</code> and <code>y</code> can also equal <code>1</code>, <code>V1</code> could represent a <code>boolean</code> and <code>V2</code> could also represent a <code>boolean</code>.</em></p><h2 id="A-unit-pure-from-method"><a href="#A-unit-pure-from-method" class="headerlink" title="A unit/pure/from method"></a>A <code>unit</code>/<code>pure</code>/<code>from</code> method</h2><p>The from method follows this signature:<br><figure class="highlight typescript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Given a value of type T, return a monadic value TMonad</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// that holds the provided value.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">T value</span>) =&gt; <span class="title">TMonad</span>&lt;<span class="title">T</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>This should be quite simple.

These laws ensure that all monads compose the same way and in some functional languages, they enable some pretty cool functions and operators that just work for all monadic types.

The first example creates merges <code>A</code> to <code>F</code> (the monad produced from <code>fnF</code>) and then <code>AF</code> is merged with <code>G</code> to give <code>AFG</code>. The second example takes the value from <code>A</code>, creates <code>F</code>, merges it with <code>G</code> (implicitly by fmapping it to <code>fnG</code>) to produce <code>FG</code> and then finally merges <code>A</code> with <code>FG</code>.</p><p>The point is that it shouldn’t matter in what order these monads are created or merged to each other, <code>AFG</code> in both cases should be identical.</p><p><em>Caveat: if we were working with immutable types, the two monads would be identical, however if not, then the only difference between the two monads should be where they are in memory.

If you haven’t read about functors, rest assured that it is not important to understand for this article.</p><h2 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples!"></a>Examples!</h2><h3 id="List"><a href="#List" class="headerlink" title="List"></a>List</h3><p>The list monad is quite interesting because to understand it, you have to limit your view of it to a subset of its functionality. Remember you can do a lot with lists:</p><ul><li>You can count the items inside</li><li>You can <code>slice</code>, <code>reduce</code>, etc.</li></ul><p>From a monadic point of view, a <code>List</code> represents <code>indeterminism</code>; a set of possible values of type T. The simplest of its type is a list of one value. Let’s make that value <code>D4</code>. It represents a position on a chess board.</p><p>Now we have a function that can calculate, given a single position, all the possible positions that a knight could end up in after one move. That is an array of up to eight possible values (less if we started close to the edge of the board).</p><p>Now we want to know all the positions after two moves. We can take each of the single positions from the first calculation and call the same function again. Now we have eight lists!</p><p>This is where the merge comes to play. The merge happened in the first instance too, but it’s more obvious here. The basic list monad will concatenate the lists. Each operation can actually change the type T to say T2, but the resulting list will then have all resulting values with the same type T2. At least in a typed language. <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p><p>To see an example of what a List monad does internally, and how code would look without it, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/dipunm/monads/blob/master/listComposition.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listComposition.js</a></p><p><em>One thing to keep note of, is that the value stored within a monad should not be restricted. That is, we should not expect any special type of value. In Haskell, <code>Set</code> cannot be a monad because a <code>Set</code> requires that its values are orderable and therefore must implement the interface <code>Ord</code>. That being said, I have read about <code>restricted monads</code> which is a concept that exists in order to work around this problem. This is beyond the scope of my knowledge, but I wonder if it applies in Javascript where everything can be compared?</em></p><h3 id="Maybe"><a href="#Maybe" class="headerlink" title="Maybe"></a>Maybe</h3><p>By now we have determined that one of the things that a <code>Monad</code> can do, is control how many <code>values</code> of type <code>T</code> it wants to hold. Well, that value can also become 0. More on this soon…</p><p>The <code>Maybe</code> monad has two factory methods: <code>Just(x)</code> which takes a parameter <code>x</code>, and <code>Nothing()</code> which takes no parameters. It can hold either one value, or zero values. Even though <code>Nothing</code> takes no values, it still represents a <code>Monad</code>; it’s a monad of 0 values of type <code>T</code>. You may need to let that sink in a bit.</p><p>So how does the <code>Maybe</code> monad merge? Just like the array, we take each value we have and send it to the <code>f</code> function. For each monad we get back, we merge them. Fortunately, we can only ever get back a monad with one or less values, so we never have to worry about merging a maybe with multiple values. The maybe monad does this:</p><ul><li>If the new monad is <code>Just x</code> we just return it.</li><li>If the new monad is <code>Nothing</code> we still just return it.</li></ul><p>The moment we have <code>Nothing</code>, any function <code>f</code> provided to the <code>fmap</code> function becomes uncallable; we have no value to give to it. At this point, we just return a new <code>Nothing</code> that returns a nothing of type <code>T2</code> where <code>TMonad&lt;T2&gt;</code> represents the type that <code>f</code> would have returned (assuming we are in a typed language).</p><p>That is the mechanics of a <code>Maybe</code>; but what is it useful for? Due to its nature, it is very good at taking a sequence of computations, each that could fail to produce a value and <code>fail-fast</code> or terminate early as soon as it gets a <code>Nothing</code>. None of the following <code>f</code> in <code>fmap(f)</code> are ever executed which can save computation time.</p><p>Here is an example of a typical use of the <code>Maybe</code> monad:</p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> x = <span class="string">"hello micheal"</span>;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> specialLetter = Maybe.from(x)</span><br><span class="line">    .fmap(removeHelloOrReturnNothing) <span class="comment">// gives us Just("micheal").</span></span><br><span class="line">    .fmap(get10thChar) <span class="comment">// there is no 10th character, return Nothing().</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// note: the use of Maybe.from here allows us to take a non monadic value </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// and convert it into a monadic value to be merged by the fmap method.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// this helps us to avoid re-writing simple methods into Maybe specific</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// methods unnecessarily.</span></span><br><span class="line">    .fmap(<span class="function"><span class="params">x</span> =&gt;</span> Maybe.from(uppercase(x))); <span class="comment">// nothing to uppercase.</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(specialLetter.hasValue) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'success!'</span>, specialLetter.Value);</span><br><span class="line">&#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'oops, something went wrong.'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Notice that at the end, we use two properties: <code>hasValue</code> and <code>Value</code>. These are not part of its monadic properties in the same way that <code>length</code> is not a part of the monadic properties of <code>List</code>. They are, however very useful.</p><p>In Haskell, there is a convenience syntax called the <code>do</code> notation. This allows us to write our code in a somewhat procedural looking way. The closest thing to this in Javascript is the generator function syntax. I won’t go into detail about what we need to do to get this code working in a real application, but I will show what monadic code could look like.</p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>* <span class="title">getSpecialLetter</span>(<span class="params">greetingMessage</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> name = <span class="keyword">yield</span> removeHelloOrReturnNothing(greetingMessage);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> char = <span class="keyword">yield</span> get10thChar(name);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> specialValue = uppercase(char);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> Maybe.from(specialValue);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> letter = _do(getSpecialLetter,[<span class="string">'hello micheal'</span>]);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (letter.hasValue) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Pretty simple, standard looking code. Hopefully, it should by now be clear that the <code>Maybe</code> monad is allowing us to write our sequence of operations without worrying about the edge case of Nothing being returned. It will <code>fails-fast™</code>. Once the sequence is complete, you usually need to take care of the <code>Nothing</code> by executing a backup plan, and by possibly logging an error. In the case it didn’t fail, usually the <code>Maybe</code> type has done its job and the resulting internal value is what you’re really after.</p><h3 id="Either-a"><a href="#Either-a" class="headerlink" title="Either a"></a>Either a</h3><p>The <code>Either</code> monad is interesting. Monads must only represent one value type. <code>Either</code> is known to represent two value types.</p><p>Either as a type has two useful properties called: <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> and a <code>isLeft()</code> and/or <code>isRight()</code> method for convenience. The properties are named generically because it generally is used for holding <strong>one value</strong> of any two types; the property that the value exists in depends on the type. </p><p>When used as a monadic type, it is usually used for error detection. The type of <code>Left</code> becomes the error type, and the type of <code>Right</code> becomes the value type.

Okay, they’re all vastly different, which is why it can be hard to identify the pattern and give <code>Monads</code> a good description. But what if I told you that this monad never holds a value, and yet always produces a new monadic value using the function <code>f</code>?</p><p>This monad never holds a value, this is true, but just like the <code>Either</code> monad, it has an internal state; it holds a function that takes no value, and returns a value of type <code>A</code>. (We can call this a <code>Thunk</code>.. because mathematicians.)</p><p><em>I won’t talk about how the types compose too much here, because it gets pretty confusing as it is and types actually make it harder to wrap your head around it. :(</em></p><p>The simplest <code>thunk</code> we can make is something like: <code>() =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;</code>; you call it, and you get a value. The return value of the thunk is the type <code>A</code> that was mentioned just above. The point of a future is that it is lazy; it won’t try to execute any thunk until you explicitly tell it to execute. Just like <code>Either</code> has an <code>isLeft()</code> method, a <code>Future</code> would expose a <code>run()</code> method and calling this, will cause the thunk to execute and the final value to be revealed. This operation would be a thread blocking operation if called directly in a thread handling language; in <code>Haskell</code>, the closest monad of its type is the <code>IO</code> monad and the compiler will handle the execution for you provided that your <code>main</code> function returns an <code>IO</code> monad.</p><p>A more complicated thunk could be something like this:<br><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">makeThunk(filename) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// pseudo OS level code here:</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">const</span> handle = OS.readFile(filename);</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">const</span> data = OS.waitFor(handle); </span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// let's pretend that the OS knows that this </span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// routine should pause, hybernate and continue</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// when the file has been read.

It works with the underlying OS to do something that takes time without blocking a CPU thread. This is typically internal code that an application developer wouldn’t write, we would instead write something like <code>Future.readFile(&#39;readme.txt&#39;)</code> and just like magic, we end up with the above thunk.</p><p>I intentionally embedded this thunk inside a factory method to show how a thunk could depend on a value even though it takes no parameters.</p><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> monad = Future.from(<span class="string">'readme.txt'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .fmap(Future.readFile)</span><br><span class="line">    .fmap(<span class="function"><span class="params">contents</span> =&gt;</span> Future.from(getFirst20Chars(contents)));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Hopefully by now we understand the snippet above and what it does. <code>monad</code> will not contain the final value, but it will have a <code>Run</code> method that can eventually provide that value.

monad, or if there was an error, then we use the <code>Errored</code> function to return a new monad in its error state; this state has no value and will fast track the execution like the <code>Either</code> monad would.</p><p>The <code>solrClient</code> change looks more complicated, and that is because by design, the solrClient was built to return a boolean that represented if it was successful instead of throwing an error. Instead of relying on <code>catch</code> to split the logic, we use an <code>if</code> statement. If successful, we track information about what happened, if not, we indicate Errored without any context (we have none ourselves because any internal exceptions would have been handled).</p><p>The final step for both cases is to use the <code>from</code> method (here called <code>of</code>) to ensure our function returns the correct value inside the <code>Tracker</code> monad.</p><h1 id="Promises-and-Monads-in-Javascript"><a href="#Promises-and-Monads-in-Javascript" class="headerlink" title="Promises and Monads in Javascript"></a>Promises and Monads in Javascript</h1><p><strong>Promises are not <code>monads</code>;</strong> you can quote me on that. They have the required methods (namely <code>resolve</code> and <code>then</code>) and they follow the rules to a certain extent, but they were never created with the intention of being <code>monadic</code>. They were created with the intention of easing imperative style asynchronous code. <a href="https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/issues/94#issuecomment-366157872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[source]</a></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/JonSchapiro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Schapiro</a> who pointed out that since Promises are eager, they may be breaking the associativity law. A good example of this, would be to create two promises, one that writes “hello” onto the page, and the other writes “world”. If you wanted to compose it in reverse: <code>worldPromise.then(() =&gt; helloPromise);</code>, the program will not swap the order of execution because it already executed the promises.</p><p>Even so, promises are useful. If we need to or want to create agnostic, reusable code, we can choose to use another library, or to monkey patch promises to make them conform better. That being said, we will also have to monkey patch other non-conforming would-be-monads, and it is unlikely that Javascript will build convenient keywords that could help legibility any time soon.</p><p>There are a lot of articles that discuss Promises and their impurity, but one article highlights a few pretty interesting side effects due to having eager execution. <a href="https://staltz.com/promises-are-not-neutral-enough.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[source]</a></p><p><strong>Promises are like <code>monads</code>.</strong> Notice how with the <code>Maybe</code> monad, where we used the <code>generator function</code> syntax, we never do any error handling inside? When using <code>async/await</code>, if we are trying to write like for like code, we should be grouping a sequence of asynchronous operations together without any error handling as well. Until we exit the async function and get back a <code>Promise</code>, we can’t really access the properties and methods of <code>Promise</code> directly and so we can’t use the <code>catch</code> method.</p><p>The point is to group a sequence of async operations without thinking about edge cases, and then handle the errors at the end. Consider this:<br><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">fetch(<span class="string">'http://www.my-url.com/endpoint'</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">data</span> =&gt;</span> fetch(<span class="string">'http://internal.com/get/'</span> + data.id))</span><br><span class="line">    .then(<span class="function"><span class="params">person</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.delay(<span class="number">20</span>).then(person))</span><br><span class="line">    .catch(<span class="function"><span class="params">err</span> =&gt;</span> handle(err))</span><br><span class="line">    .then(....);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Notice how there are a bunch of thens before the catch?

This type of separation can start to become nonsensical; your error handling moves away which can be a problem if you are used to executing logic and handling errors in one place.</p><p>There is another way though:<br><figure class="highlight ts"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">async</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">doStuff</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> person = <span class="keyword">await</span> (<span class="keyword">async</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">const</span> data = <span class="keyword">await</span> fetch(<span class="string">'http://www.my-url.com/endpoint'</span>);</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">const</span> person = <span class="keyword">await</span> fetch(<span class="string">'http://internal.com/get/'</span> + data.id);</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">await</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.delay(<span class="number">20</span>);</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> person;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;)().catch(<span class="function"><span class="params">err</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> handle(err)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">//... continue operations here using the person variable.</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">doStuff();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>Embedding functions inside one another is quite normal in Javascript. There are concerns amongst my fellow peer developers that using <code>try/catch</code> to handle errors generally causes performance issues. Exceptions should be for exceptional cases; yet many promises reject for valid reasons without exceptions and using the catch method for promises feels less controversial than using a <code>try/catch</code> pair. Happily, the level of nesting remains consistent and so do variable scopes (<em>maybe not for vars</em>) so this style of code can feel familiar, be easier to reason about, and should be easier to debug than the declaritive style of programming that promise chaining provides.</p><p>The biggest downside is that <code>return</code> keyword doesn’t terminate the function anymore so formatting it to look like a try/catch may cause misunderstandings down the line; only experimentation and time can tell. There could be better ways to avoid using try/catch unnecessarily whilst keeping the style more procedural looking. There are many ways to skin a cat.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For most people circuit breakers are a concept that belongs in the world of electricity. They are usually a box of fuses under the stairs that prevents the tangle of extension cords from turning into an unexpected open fireplace behind the TV. But the concept of a circuit breaker is something that we can apply to software and software services. </p><p>Martin Fowler described a software circuit breaker as follows:</p><blockquote><p>“… a protected function call in a circuit breaker object, which monitors for failures. Once the failures reach a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and all further calls to the circuit breaker return with an error, without the protected call being made at all” </p></blockquote><h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>OpenTable runs on many microservices that depend on one another to deliver the OpenTable site. These services can have dependencies on data stores such as MongoDB and Elastic Search as well as services such as RabbitMQ and Redis. Sometimes these dependencies can have performance or availability issues; such as when somebody accidentally drops an index on a collection in Mongo. </p><blockquote><p>This actually happened, your author accidentally dropped a critical index while working with a DB synchronization tool which resulted in downtime. Hence this article.</p></blockquote><p>When this happens calls to dependencies may fail or take a long time to complete which then causes the dependent service to behave in the same way. Other upstream services can also suffer the same problem. This can be described as a cascading failure.</p><p>Ideally what we would like to happen at this point is for our service to recognize what is happening, fail gracefully, and stop calling the service that already can’t keep up with the load placed upon it. (As well as alerting us to the problem). This is where a software circuit breaker can help us.</p><p><img src="/images/posts/polly-logo.png" style="float:right;margin:0 0 2rem 2rem;width:20rem;"></p><h2 id="Polly-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Polly-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Polly to the rescue"></a>Polly to the rescue</h2><p>Polly (<a href="http://www.thepollyproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.thepollyproject.org/</a>) - is a transient fault handling library which includes an implementation of a software circuit breaker (amongst other things which we will come to later). The <a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly#resilience-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a> for Polly is excellent so I won’t try to replicate it here. </p><h3 id="How-we-used-Polly"><a href="#How-we-used-Polly" class="headerlink" title="How we used Polly"></a>How we used Polly</h3><p>As you would expect we wrapped calls to external services in Polly circuit breakers (using the Advanced Circuit Breaker policy) and configured it with an arbitrary failure threshold which we thought would protect downstream services that are overwhelmed. But then we went one step further…</p><p>A circuit breaker has state, we wanted to be able to see what that state was as it provides insight into the state of our service. To achieve this, we named every circuit breaker instance according to what it protected (RabbitMQ, external Services or Mongo collection names). We then made that state accessible on an endpoint of our API. This allows us to use our monitoring tools to alert us when one of the breakers Opens, providing us with early warning of failures and making it easier to pin-point the failure.</p><p>We created a CircuitBreakerRegistry, initialized as a singleton instance within our DI container, which lets us store a handle to a CircuitBreakerPolicy with its unique name, or retrieve all stored policies and retrieve by name. </p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">CircuitBreakerRegistry</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">StoreCircuitBreaker</span>(<span class="params">CircuitBreakerPolicy policy , <span class="keyword">string</span> breakerId</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            ...</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        </span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> ConcurrentDictionary&lt;<span class="keyword">string</span>, CircuitBreakerPolicy&gt; <span class="title">GetAllRegisteredBreakers</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            ...</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> CircuitBreakerPolicy <span class="title">GetCircuitNamedBreaker</span>(<span class="params"><span class="keyword">string</span> breakerId</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"></span>        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            ...</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We then created an API controller that allows us to retrieve a list of all registered Circuit Breakers along with their current state.

This could be useful for several reasons including:</p><ul><li>to test our fall-back strategy</li><li>if we knew a dependency was going to fail or in a failing state (but not triggering the breaker)</li><li>if we knew a dependency had a bad deploy that might take a while to rollback/fix. </li></ul><blockquote><p>You might think that Closed is bad and Open is good. It’s the other way around in circuit breakers as a switch that is open in a circuit breaks the circuit. When it is closed the circuit is complete and electricity/data can flow.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>I’ve already mentioned that the reason for my interest in Circuit Breakers and this post was through direct experience of downtime I caused. The truth is I have always been interested in Circuit Breaker technology and application resilience in general, but this incident focused time and attention on the problem. </p><p>Clearly this is a case of “Locking the stable door after the horse has bolted” but that’s often the way in engineering. However, something like this might happen again and I would rather put measures in place to deal with it ahead of time. You might argue that given an Open circuit breaker can only fail fast or return an empty result, it makes no difference to the user experience as the data they want to view isn’t available either way. This is true to a degree, but a Circuit Breaker isolates only broken aspects of a service allowing the rest to function normally. Failing fast also means that the user experience of other aspects of the site are unaffected which is better than potentially impacting the whole site.</p><h3 id="Insurance…"><a href="#Insurance…" class="headerlink" title="Insurance…"></a>Insurance…</h3><p>…is something everybody buys and hopes to never use. Protecting your application with Circuit Breakers and other application resilience measures is one of those things that you should really do, but hope to never need. There is of course a cost involved in adding such measures and it is up to you to decide whether you think it is worth it. </p><h2 id="Application-Resilience"><a href="#Application-Resilience" class="headerlink" title="Application Resilience"></a>Application Resilience</h2><p>The Circuit Breaker pattern is only one of many Application Resilience Patterns. If you have already looked at the Polly Project Web site you may have seen that it lists several different Application Resilience policies that it offers. Briefly these are:</p><ul><li>Retry (which is where the Polly name comes from)</li><li>Circuit Breakers (already covered)</li><li>Timeout</li><li>Bulkhead Isolation (think of it as a predictive circuit breaker)</li><li>Cache</li><li>Fall-back </li></ul><p>These are by no means a definitive list of Application Resilience measures but are a good starting point. </p><p>Again, the documentation on the Polly website describe these in detail so I won’t repeat it here other than to say these Application Resilience methods are something that you might want to consider using alongside Circuit Breaker policies. We use Retry inside of a Circuit Breaker (using the Policy Wrap) to overcome transient faults. We apply a Timeout policy when calling some 3rd party client libraries that have no built-in timeout mechanism. For instance, a version of RabbitMQ for .NET will block our application start-up if the configured RabbitMQ instance is not running on the target host. A forced timeout ensures that our application fails and informs us of why.</p><h2 id="Other-Libraries"><a href="#Other-Libraries" class="headerlink" title="Other Libraries"></a>Other Libraries</h2><p>Polly is a great library for .NET developers and there are similar libraries are available in other languages. Hysterix (<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix</a>) is one such tool that you may have already heard of as it was developed by Netflix and is written for Java applications. There is a version of Polly in Javascript called PollyJs (<a href="https://github.com/mauricedb/polly-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/mauricedb/polly-js</a>) that provides retry and there are of course packages that implement Circuit Breakers in Javascript as well.</p><h2 id="Final-thoughts"><a href="#Final-thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final thoughts"></a>Final thoughts</h2><p>If you decide to use any of these existing frameworks, roll your own or simply implement these patterns directly into your application, the key thing to consider is how you want your application to behave during failure. You should consider how it will affect its upstream clients and how they will react to your application in different states as this is not always as obvious as you might expect. Most importantly, consider the business impact of your failure modes on the customer. You should aim to minimize the impact on the user experience and think about how much you want to tell them when you are offering a reduced service. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This June, OpenTable hosted the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Study-Group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London Machine Learning Study Group</a> to great success. We provided the food, drinks, and space for an extremely talented speaker and over 100 RSVPs. It was also my first experience hosting an external meetup at OpenTable - and I learned a lot!</p><h2 id="My-Experience"><a href="#My-Experience" class="headerlink" title="My Experience"></a>My Experience</h2><p>OpenTable has frequently hosted meetups in our office such as <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WebPlatform-London/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Platform London</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/webdeldn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEBdeLDN</a>. However, acting as an event host was a complete unknown for me, so leading up to the machine learning event, I made a point of sitting down with someone who had organised one before.</p><p>We documented the key steps in setting up an external event, and then published what we’d discussed on our internal wiki so as to avoid siloing useful information for future use. Following the steps documented in the wiki proved invaluable in reducing my stress on the day.</p><p>After our last event we also looked back on how we’d done the last few events.</p><h2 id="Retrospective"><a href="#Retrospective" class="headerlink" title="Retrospective"></a>Retrospective</h2><p>Following our last meetup, we held a retrospective as, along with the London Machine Learning Study Group, we have had a recent spate of meetups at OpenTable. This was extremely useful to underline our shared experiences as well as the considerations we want to make for our next external event. Here are a few areas we will look to improve.</p><h3 id="Push-social-media-more"><a href="#Push-social-media-more" class="headerlink" title="Push social media more"></a>Push social media more</h3><p>We want the largest number of people to know about these events ahead of time, which means not just relying on one platform. Instead we aim to advertise our meetups on all channels available to us to get as diverse an audience as possible. We will tweet about our events more via <a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@OpenTableTechUK</a> and we will use this blog to advertise upcoming events.</p><h3 id="A-lot-of-people-don’t-turn-up"><a href="#A-lot-of-people-don’t-turn-up" class="headerlink" title="A lot of people don’t turn up"></a>A lot of people don’t turn up</h3><p>This is completely expected for a free meetup, but we want to be able to provide food and drink without too much wastage. In our experience actual attendance can vary between 40-70% of the RSVP but we have no concrete formula for estimating. We presume it depends on the number/quality of speakers and the topic – and perhaps even the weather. Next time we will be more conservative with pizza, but we don’t mind over ordering drinks as they be drunk in our weekly office happy hour!</p><h3 id="More-mingling"><a href="#More-mingling" class="headerlink" title="More mingling"></a>More mingling</h3><p>Understandably, attendees can feel too shy to freely interact, which is a real shame as this casual networking is a source of great value of these kinds of meetups. For our next meetups, we will do what we can to get people mixing together; we’ll look at how long before the start we ask people to arrive, as hosts we’ll do more to interact with people and get them talking, as well as perhaps strategically placing the food to bring more people together and avoid having guests sit down by themselves.</p><h2 id="Watch-this-Space"><a href="#Watch-this-Space" class="headerlink" title="Watch this Space!"></a>Watch this Space!</h2><p>OpenTable greatly values meetups: As with our Open Source initiatives, we see meetups as part of our commitment to open collaboration and communication within the developer community. We aim to hold many more in the future so watch this space! If you are an event host, please get in touch via <a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@OpenTableTechUK</a>. We are very open to suggestions and, provided we have the time and space, more than happy to accommodate.</p><p>Our next event is another <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Machine-Learning-Study-Group/events/241678923/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">London Machine Learning Study Group</a> this Thursday.

    <title>Pragmatic Testing with GraphQL</title>
    <link href="http://tech.opentable.co.uk//blog/2017/06/16/pragmatic-testing-with-graphql/"/>

    <updated>2022-05-13T19:21:14.162Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been using GraphQL at OpenTable for a little over half a year now.  I won’t go into detail as to why we started using it, but suffice to say, we really enjoyed creating our very first GraphQL endpoint.  It eased a lot of the inconsistencies that we were experiencing with some of our REST-ful services.</p><p>This post assumes you have some experience building a GraphQL endpoint.  For those of who you aren’t familiar with it, it feels a lot like having a querying language via an HTTP endpoint.  If you want to try it for yourself, I recommend <a href="https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub’s endpoint</a>.  To get started with GraphQL, <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official documentation</a> is a perfect place.</p><h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>Now, let’s get back to writing tests for an endpoint.  When we were creating our first endpoint, we started facing regression testing problems while expanding our schema.  It seemed our existing testing methods were ill-equipped to handle it.</p><p>Finding a good solution to this is important because I’ve had such a love–hate affair with testing.  All tests are not created equal and a naive developer would say, “write a test in case something changes”.  This certainly isn’t a good measure.  I’ve also found that just attempting to write tests immediately without forethought can be a costly distraction if you grow your codebase.</p><h2 id="The-Approach"><a href="#The-Approach" class="headerlink" title="The Approach"></a>The Approach</h2><p>So we took a step back and looked at the code we were writing.  Most of the connectors we wrote were fairly anemic.  We didn’t have much logic for our API nor did we want any.  We could have written unit tests for each parts of the schema but mocking portions of the system seemed more work than it was worth.</p><p>So where did we start?  I personally enjoy the outside-in approach and started writing a few acceptance tests. So, we wrote a test for each query in the schema that we had.  It would fire an HTTP request and expect a 200 status code and have no errors in the resulting JSON body.  Thanks to GraphQL most errors are handily reported using this mechanism so we would be able to make a decent impact using little work.</p><img src="/images/posts/graphql-base-tests.gif" class="left"><p>As you can see, we found that this would be good enough at the time but eventually found that it would not scale very well.  If you forget to update one of these queries, you could leave out a major section out accidentally.  Being a big fan of automation, we wondered how we could scale this out.</p><h2 id="The-Solution"><a href="#The-Solution" class="headerlink" title="The Solution"></a>The Solution</h2><p>We knew GraphiQL (the web interface for testing GraphQL queries) was using introspection to give us intellisense.  What a great idea: we could leverage introspection in a similar way to discover all the possible queries for a given endpoint.  After doing so, we repeated our previous tests, which was to fire an HTTP request.</p><p>So how would you generate queries with parameters?  For example numDice is required for this query:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">rollDice(numDice: 4, numSides: 6) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">name</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So, how would we be able to provide a valid parameter to a query that we’ve discovered in this endpoint?  We believe, this is a great opportunity to kill two birds with one stone!  Write an example in your documentation/comments for your query and we’ll re-use it as a test!</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type Query &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  # RollDice has four examples</span><br><span class="line">  #</span><br><span class="line">  # Examples:</span><br><span class="line">  # rollDice(numDice: 4, numSides: 2)</span><br><span class="line">  # rollDice( numDice : 40 , numSides:2)</span><br><span class="line">  # rollDice ( numDice: 2, numSides: 299 )</span><br><span class="line">  # rollDice (</span><br><span class="line">  #   numDice:4,</span><br><span class="line">  #   numSides: 2342</span><br><span class="line">  # )</span><br><span class="line">  rollDice(numDice: Int!, numSides: Int): RandomDie</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>From this, all we did is write examples for every single one of our queries and re-run our methodology.</p><p>We thought that we wouldn’t be the only ones running into this problem so we decided to open source this tool: <a href="https://github.com/opentable/graphql-query-generator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graphql-query-generator</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we were excited to kick-off our first OpenTable Global Hackathon, underway simultaneously in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Melbourne, and right here in London. Having personally never attended a hackathon before let alone helped organise one I was initially daunted, but with some careful planning, good suggestions from the team and a fair amount of making it up as we went along, the end result was quite a success.</p><p>This post discusses what format our hackathon took, what challenges we faced in coordinating across countries, the experience in the London office and what we learned.</p><h2 id="The-basic-format"><a href="#The-basic-format" class="headerlink" title="The basic format"></a>The basic format</h2><p>The hackathon was conceived in our San Francisco headquarters and could easily have been confined to that one office, but I was delighted to learn is was intended to be a global event from the outset. The basic format, described below, was however optimised for our SF office.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the hackathon, individuals were asked to submit their hack proposals. Idea prompts were circulated such as “engages and delights diners” or “socially connected”, as well as the judging criteria; <strong>Originality</strong>, <strong>Feasibility</strong>, <strong>Likely to adopt</strong>, <strong>Fidelity of prototype</strong>, <strong>Business impact</strong> and <strong>Captivating presentation</strong>.</p><p>One week before the hackathon, our San Francisco office held a ‘happy-hour’ in which everyone taking part mingled and discussed ideas.  This social event encouraged the developers, designers and product owners to self-organise into teams and submit their proposals in advance.</p><p>The hackathon itself was devised as a 2½ day event, running from Tuesday morning to Thursday lunchtime during normal working hours, with OpenTable providing breakfast and lunch.  Live incidents or outages still had to be fixed, but otherwise the teams would be uninterrupted for the duration.</p><p>The hackathon concluded with each team having up to five minutes to present their hack to their colleagues and the judges.  The awards were for the top three hacks, special CEO and CTO’s prizes, and an open vote - and generous cash prizes and gifts were up for grabs.</p><h2 id="Tweaks-for-the-London-version-and-building-enthusiasm"><a href="#Tweaks-for-the-London-version-and-building-enthusiasm" class="headerlink" title="Tweaks for the London version and building enthusiasm"></a>Tweaks for the London version and building enthusiasm</h2><p>The big headache in London that we always have to live with is the eight hour time difference between London and San Francisco - and the same constraint obviously existed for the hackathon. Each team concluded that it wouldn’t be feasible to form teams across the offices so all our build-up and actual hacking remained independent. However we submitted our recorded presentations for the final judging along with the rest of the company.</p><p>To get our ideas flowing we set up a kick-off session which we called “Beers and Ideas” - half an hour at the end of the Friday preceding the hackathon. Each individual with an idea was asked to pitch it to their colleagues with the intent to recruit team-mates. This format seemed to be popular and rolled seamlessly into our regular Friday office drinks where the ‘recruitment’ could continue.  Some engineers and product managers pitched their ideas even though they couldn’t attend the hackathon itself.</p><p>Our design team in SF supplied posters which we put up around the office to raise awareness of the event amongst colleagues and invite them to submit ideas. We were also sent t-shirts that were handed out to the hackers.</p><p>One rule we introduced in London was that every hack team had to include someone with which you do not normally work. This was not an arduous stipulation and all teams managed to cross-pollinate with each other.</p><p>Just before we started hacking we had a short meeting to finalise the teams and projects. This was the last opportunity for anyone without a team to join an existing team or join forces together. Most people had already made their decisions, but three or four people found their projects at this late stage.</p><p>Our London hackathon culminated with a joint session at which we watched each other’s demos.  All teams decided to record in advance rather than giving a live presentation and we gathered to watch these often very funny videos as a group.</p><p>Finally, we introduced a “Best Hack in London” award. This bonus, regional award added some drama and tension, preventing an anti-climax at the end of our day - as we had to wait until 1am to hear the global awards live from SF.</p><h2 id="How-did-it-go"><a href="#How-did-it-go" class="headerlink" title="How did it go?"></a>How did it go?</h2><p>Overall, the event was a big success.  Five teams in the London office worked on six ideas, and 45 hacks projects were undertaken globally.</p><p>This positive outcome was despite a slow start. Having never held a Hackathon at OpenTable before it felt like many people were cautious about how successful it would be.  In the UK we enjoy “20% time” - that is 20% of each sprint for engineers to undertake personal development, prototyping and other non-sprint work to grow themselves or the business - and so for many, a hackathon seemed like it could be just another 20% time, nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>However once we got under way it quickly became apparent that it was much different.  The advance planning, focus and critically the lack of interruptions clearly differentiated this from our typical two days of 20% time.</p><p>The teams ranged in size from seven (including product and designers), to a pair of engineers. The work undertaken also ranged from the hugely ambitious ‘moonshots’ that could revolutionise the business, to simpler infrastructure improvements and dashboards relying on the developers’ day-to-day skills and experience.</p><p>A handful of people chose not to take part, instead taking the decision to continue with their sprint work. Additionally we had a couple of production issues during the event, but fortunately these only took one or two people from the hackathon for a couple of hours.</p><p>Providing the meals was a headache and not something I’d want to do too often!  Pizza on the first day was nice and easy, although they arrived late and one looked like it had been dropped. On the second day we chose a restaurant on Deliveroo, I collected everyone’s order and then couldn’t order online… So I placed the order over the phone and asked one of the team to collect it with the department credit card - but forgot to give them the PIN (and the restaurant forgot to give us the rice, for which I was blamed!). Finally, I managed to order online on day three, but even then it took ages to deliver and what arrived was wrong.  This was undoubtedly the most stressful element of the event and clearly not one of my strengths.</p><p>I was also unexpectedly asked to “star” in a hackathon video, “acting” as a restaurateur.  Watching it back was quite cringeworthy - my acting skills are not as strong as I’d thought.</p><p>The final presentation of all the hacks was a high-energy,  enjoyable conclusion to the event. Our co-ordinator in SF did a good job lining up 40 back-to-back live presentations to multiple remote offices, but inevitably there were some audiovisual difficulties.  One final disappointment in London was that the winners were not emailed to the global office, meaning many of us excitedly checked our emails upon waking but had to wait much later to find out if they’d won.</p><h2 id="What-did-we-learn"><a href="#What-did-we-learn" class="headerlink" title="What did we learn?"></a>What did we learn?</h2><p>From the feedback after the event, everyone felt the event was relevant and helpful for their jobs.  Engineers commented that it gave them experience of what technology to use in certain situations - and what not to use. Another engineer was able to complete a proof of concept that she had been unable to make time for in the sprint.</p><p>A number of people have commented that the prizes were too great and the competitiveness skews the engineering value of the event. Whilst we didn’t know the prizes in advance, if they are as substantial next year then I fear there is a risk of people prioritising high-risk, dramatic projects at the expense of experimenting with smaller ideas - ideas that won’t win but can still provide value.  Competitiveness could also tempt people to start projects early, form huge teams and focus more on slick presentations rather than engineering excellence.  This is not necessarily to be avoided, but should be balanced.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the company will follow up on the ideas that were worked on in the Hackathon. It would be great to see the time and effort spent built upon to turn some of the ideas into product deliverables, and in London we will try to at least continue some of our technical projects in 20% time.</p><p>Another piece of useful feedback was a recommendation to set minimum and maximum team sizes. One of the teams of two in London struggled to balance their responsibilities, and most of the winning teams across the company all seemed to have 7-10 members. Limiting teams to three to six people seems like a good compromise to improve productivity but also level the playing field.</p><p>Finally another initiative we wish to try is to coordinate one 20% period per quarter for an unofficial hackathon just in the UK. If we can coordinate with other departments then there is a real appetite to undertake more frequent cross-team, project-based initiatives.  As for the main event itself, I’ve yet to gather feedback from the San Francisco office, but from the London point of view it was a big success and something we hope can become an annual undertaking.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Quarterly team goals are an effective way to establish organisational purpose, direction and alignment while supporting team agility. But be vigilant - they can be used inappropriately.</strong></p><h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>Due to factors such as growth, acquisition, changing markets amongst others, organisations can find themselves in new environments to which they struggle to adapt.</p><p>Scaling Agile in these new environments is hard. The practices and tools that are frequently used to solve this problem can give the appearance of acting against team autonomy and agility. Teams and individuals naturally try to protect the engineering culture that they have worked hard to establish but by allowing new organisational needs to go unmet they put their autonomy and agility at risk.</p><p>In this post I will show how quarterly goal setting, using Agile principles and with one eye on the dysfunctions that can arise, is an effective way to meet organisational needs while protecting team agility and engineering culture.</p><h2 id="What-needs-are-we-trying-to-meet"><a href="#What-needs-are-we-trying-to-meet" class="headerlink" title="What needs are we trying to meet?"></a>What needs are we trying to meet?</h2><p>Senior leaders in an organisation need confidence that the creativity, intelligence, skills and knowledge of their employees are directed most effectively towards delivering long term business objectives. Ensuring that teams are aligned around those business objectives is traditionally called governance.</p><p>The top-down command-and-control connotations of that term do not sit comfortably in modern software development and rightly so. The responsibility for organisational alignment should rest with teams and individuals. </p><p>A bottom-up approach to organisational alignment relies on transparency. Everyone in the business needs to know the business objectives and what all teams are doing to meet the objectives. Arguably the primary output of all product development and engineering teams is a statement of intent and a narrative of their progress.</p><p>Put another way, the first output of all knowledge work is shared, actionable knowledge - we can then decide how best to utilise that knowledge. Teams need to know that the decisions that they are making right now are the right decisions for the business. Without full transparency this is not possible. </p><p>In medium to large organisations dependencies between teams are inevitable and I would argue not undesirable. Efforts to structure an organisation and system architecture in such a way that teams are able to work in isolation can reduce friction and time to market.</p><p>But at scale this becomes unrealistic without product, technology and knowledge fragmentation. Cross team collaboration can fail and cause unnecessary friction without organisational support and guidance. The ‘improvised collaboration’ that takes place daily and is essential for a business to innovate and succeed needs a framework of ‘scripted collaboration’ so that teams and individuals can assess the impact of requests from and to other teams, and avoid the false sense of urgency that arises without clear direction on the business priorities.</p><p>Teams and individuals also need a sense of how their work contributes to the larger whole. A sense of purpose and direction is intrinsically motivating. Similarly team autonomy and the space to make your own decisions are important aspects of any company culture that values its employees and wants to make the most of their talents.</p><p>However, they come under threat when a business lacks clear vision and priorities or the vision and priorities are not understood by everyone in the business.</p><h3 id="The-learning-organisation"><a href="#The-learning-organisation" class="headerlink" title="The learning organisation"></a>The learning organisation</h3><p>By holding regular retrospectives and fostering a spirit of experimentation and continuous improvement teams have become adept at locking in their learning through process and system improvements. But how does an organisation as a whole achieve this?</p><p>If everything is experienced as change then nothing is. We’re just floundering in the zone of chaos. The organisation needs a lightweight means to capture its intent, key decisions, the evolution of plans and actual outcomes. Think of this as a thin slice or low-res snapshot of our current shared understanding. Once captured we can refer to it when evaluating the impact of change. Without this reference the organisation is reactive with little understanding of the impact of its decisions over the medium and long term. </p><p>The tool that OpenTable has chosen to achieve organisational alignment, create a sense of purpose and direction and to act as a foundation to support learning is quarterly goals.</p><h2 id="Inappropriate-use-of-goals"><a href="#Inappropriate-use-of-goals" class="headerlink" title="Inappropriate use of goals"></a>Inappropriate use of goals</h2><p>As with all tools, quarterly goals can be used inappropriately. Following Agile principles will help ensure that they are of benefit to the team and organisation but there is always scope for misinterpretation, and consequently there are approaches to goal setting that should be avoided.</p><h3 id="A-pipeline-of-work"><a href="#A-pipeline-of-work" class="headerlink" title="A pipeline of work"></a>A pipeline of work</h3><p>Goals should not be treated as a pipeline of engineering deliverables that the team are expected to deliver in priority order. Customer and stakeholder value should be the driving factor in defining goals. Simply clearing a backlog of fixed scope work items is an ineffective way to run a business such as OpenTable.</p><p>The project pipeline will be familiar to anyone who has spent time at a digital agency or production shop. By delivering a pipeline of work the agency has a guaranteed revenue stream as it is work that clients have agreed to pay for. A business such as OpenTable could successfully deliver a pipeline of work on time and within budget and still go out of business.</p><p>We should ask ourselves where do we want to be in three months time and, at this moment, what do we think we will need to do to get there. Contrast this with the approach whereby we select a number of work items from a backlog that we think we will be able to complete in three months. We should favour the first approach over the second.</p><p>Avoid thinking of goals as a pipeline of fixed, engineering deliverables.</p><h3 id="The-arbitrary-deadline-as-a-means-to-push-teams-to-deliver"><a href="#The-arbitrary-deadline-as-a-means-to-push-teams-to-deliver" class="headerlink" title="The arbitrary deadline as a means to push teams to deliver"></a>The arbitrary deadline as a means to push teams to deliver</h3><p>The three month time horizon for goals is as good an arbitrary period of time as any other. It provides a constraint for thinking beyond the current sprint and considering the medium and longer terms. But we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that it is arbitrary. </p><p>We should feel a sense of obligation to our colleagues to meet the commitments that we make to them. If we accept that all models and plans are wrong but are useful and allow us to move forward, then we should be rigorous in doing what we can to invalidate our plans as early as possible, adapt them and share this information with all stakeholders. </p><p>Teams should not be pressured into meeting a goal at all costs simply because of the impending end of quarter. We should all agree that the level of effort and duration are important factors in determining business value and prioritisation but driving teams to meet arbitrary deadlines will not help them establish a regular, sustainable pace that is the foundation for reliable forecasting.</p><p>Conversely the element of time cannot be ignored and the cost of delay to the business of not having a feature in the hands of customers beyond a certain date is too great.</p><p>Avoid treating the end of the quarter as an arbitrary deadline.</p><h3 id="A-low-tolerance-for-risk-and-change"><a href="#A-low-tolerance-for-risk-and-change" class="headerlink" title="A low tolerance for risk and change"></a>A low tolerance for risk and change</h3><p>An aligned business should not be rigid to the point that it is inflexible to changing circumstances. If business objectives change, teams should be able to adapt and realign around those new objectives.</p><p>What we assumed was important at the beginning of the quarter is very likely to be proven not to be so as the quarter progresses. New information and feedback from stakeholders, development teams and customers may invalidate our assumptions. Fast, frequent feedback and actual outcomes should allow us to adapt our goals and business objectives.</p><p>Don’t allow goals to lower our tolerance for risk and change.</p><h3 id="Silo-ed-behaviour-and-working-against-collaboration"><a href="#Silo-ed-behaviour-and-working-against-collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Silo-ed behaviour and working against collaboration"></a>Silo-ed behaviour and working against collaboration</h3><p><em>“It’s not in our goals”.</em></p><p>Once a team has agreed its goals for the quarter the temptation may be to push back on anything that is considered to fall outside of them. Only so much can be anticipated three months in advance and there will always be new requests and changing priorities.</p><p>A business that embraces change should allow for goals and business objectives to change as new information emerges. Requests that originate from outside the team should be considered in light of longer term business objectives and priorities. If this means adapting the team’s plans for the quarter then so be it if it is in the best interests of the business as a whole.</p><p>Avoid a team-first mentality.</p><h2 id="A-web-of-goals"><a href="#A-web-of-goals" class="headerlink" title="A web of goals"></a>A web of goals</h2><p><em>“How does what I’m doing right now contribute to the success of the business?”</em></p><p>This is the question that everyone in the organisation should be able to answer. It should be possible to map each story on a team’s task board to the team goal and from there to the longer term business goals. Longer term business goals can be broken down into shorter term interim goals thereby adding more levels to the hierarchy.</p><p>Taken together the business goals are the connecting threads that run through all team goals and provide the context that establishes team and organisational purpose and direction.</p><p>Below is an example of a goal hierarchy for the OpenTable Global Traveller initiative:</p><pre>> Global Traveller    > Create a global habit        > Global Platform feature parity            > Add multilingual support to start page features.</pre><p>In this example there are two levels of business goals which are needed to define the context for the value that will be realised from delivering the specific team goal - in this case adding multilingual support.</p><p>By following the links up the goal hierarchy and then back down along alternate paths, new connections and opportunities for collaboration that may otherwise go unnoticed are revealed.</p><p>Here is another example:</p><pre>> Global Platform    > Allow diners to book any restaurant on any domain in any language        > Launch all restaurants from English speaking domains in Australia            > Enable all English restaurant natural language URLs            > Enable cross domain search results        > Allow users to book in any language on OpenTable.com            > AB test a language switcher on .com            > Allow users to receive emails in their selected language</pre><p>The highlighted team goals are not dependent on each other but the connections established by the higher level business goals suggest that collaboration and coordination between the teams would be beneficial.</p><h2 id="Setting-goals"><a href="#Setting-goals" class="headerlink" title="Setting goals"></a>Setting goals</h2><h3 id="The-team-mission-statement"><a href="#The-team-mission-statement" class="headerlink" title="The team mission statement"></a>The team mission statement</h3><p>When setting goals for the first time a good place to start for any team is to consider its purpose. Why do we exist? A team mission statement can provide a framework for setting goals that have value and meaning to the team and to the business.</p><p>As an example, here is a possible mission statement for a team responsible for transactional communications:</p><ol><li><p>Maintain transactional communications systems in production so that the business has a reliable and performant transactional communications system, and customers receive timely and relevant communications.</p></li><li><p>Build transactional communications capabilities that increase value for our customers and help the business meet its objectives.</p></li><li><p>Evolve transactional communications systems in line with the company’s technical vision for the platform to position the business to best meet the evolving needs of its customers.</p></li><li><p>Foster a supportive and welcoming team culture that values innovation, collaboration and continuous learning.</p></li></ol><p>Quarterly goals can then map back to elements of the mission statement:</p><ol><li><p>Maintain transactional communications systems in production so that the business has a reliable and performant transactional communications system, and customers receive timely and relevant communications.  <strong>Reduce the level of noise from alerts so that the team can more effectively respond to production incidents.</strong></p></li><li><p>Build transactional communications capabilities that increase value for our customers and helps the business meet its objectives.  <strong>Launch a thank you email to reinforce the benefits of booking with OpenTable.</strong></p></li><li><p>Evolve transactional communications systems in line with the company’s technical vision for the platform to position the business to best meet the evolving needs of its customers.  <strong>Migrate transactional communications systems to Apache Mesos.</strong></p></li><li><p>Foster a supportive and welcoming team culture that values innovation, collaboration and continuous learning.  <strong>Create an engineer on-boarding playbook to ensure that new team members have a great first experience of the team and OpenTable.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Everything that a team does should relate to a team goal and the mission statement. </p><p>The thank you email goal example also sits within the web of goals as described above. An example of how it might relate to higher level business objectives is:</p><pre>> Increase the frequency of yearly active bookers    > Improve the post dining experience        <span style="font-weight:bold;">> Launch a thank you email to reinforce the benefits of booking with OpenTable.</span></pre><h3 id="The-anatomy-of-a-goal"><a href="#The-anatomy-of-a-goal" class="headerlink" title="The anatomy of a goal"></a>The anatomy of a goal</h3><ul><li><strong>The goal summary</strong> succinctly captures our intent.</li><li><strong>The customer and business value</strong> that this goal will unlock. This is the most important element of a goal as it defines why we think it is important.</li><li><strong>Key metrics</strong> that will tell us whether the goal has been achieved.</li><li><strong>Steps to achieve</strong> includes anything that we think is worth capturing now in terms of discrete aspects of the goal. They can include interim milestones that will give us early feedback on how we’re progressing towards the goal.</li></ul><h2 id="Reviewing-goals"><a href="#Reviewing-goals" class="headerlink" title="Reviewing goals"></a>Reviewing goals</h2><p>How should teams incorporate goals into their regular planning practices?</p><p>Sprint reviews, demos, retrospectives and planning sessions give teams a chance to reflect on and share their progress and collectively agree their next steps. We want to aim to keep the goals process as lightweight as possible and incorporating a regular review of goals into existing agile rituals is preferable. </p><p>Fifteen minutes spent reviewing a team’s goals and agreeing changes when needed every other sprint planning session adds an extra dimension to planning, and gives a team more confidence that they are making the right decisions for the coming sprint.</p><p>Goals sit alongside a number of other elements that can be incorporated into planning that help establish team situational awareness:</p><ul><li><strong>goals</strong> provide purpose and direction and are adapted based on outcomes;</li><li><strong>workflow metrics</strong> provide insight into what we’ve done and how we’ve done it and suggest improvements that we can make to our processes and practices; and</li><li><strong>maps</strong> allow us to navigate a path towards our goals.</li></ul><p>The data captured by these three elements can then be interpreted and enriched by the team to tell a story about the team’s progress and intent.</p><h2 id="The-quarterly-goal-setting-cycle"><a href="#The-quarterly-goal-setting-cycle" class="headerlink" title="The quarterly goal setting cycle"></a>The quarterly goal setting cycle</h2><p>In the same way that the team comes together to reflect and plan on a regular cadence the quarterly goal setting cycle is when the organisation as a whole does the same.</p><h3 id="The-roadmap"><a href="#The-roadmap" class="headerlink" title="The roadmap"></a>The roadmap</h3><p>So that everyone in the organisation understands the vision and business objectives the quarterly goal setting process should be kicked off with the business reiterating the medium and long term objectives. A review of progress towards those objectives and any changes that have been made since the last goal setting process should be highlighted and explained. This helps establish a consistent narrative that is essential when attempting to align an organisation towards a shared vision. </p><p>Too often a company roadmap is created and presented only to be discarded and forgotten within weeks. The same rigour combined with Agile principles applied to planning at the team level should be applied to the medium and long term business objectives.</p><p>As I have shown these are the connecting threads that run through all team goals and establish organisational purpose and context. Left to fray, tangle and rot organisational alignment is impossible.</p><p>Once the business objectives have been firmly established teams and individuals are better placed to make the right prioritisation decisions.</p><h3 id="Team-dependencies"><a href="#Team-dependencies" class="headerlink" title="Team dependencies"></a>Team dependencies</h3><p>The goal setting process provides the opportunity for the ‘scripted collaboration’ mentioned earlier that is needed to support and protect the daily ‘improvised collaboration’. When teams have agreed the things that they need to do to help the business best meet its objectives, dependencies on other teams should be called out.</p><p>Teams can then review all requests for collaboration, discuss with the relevant team and reach a shared understanding of what is expected, how they will work together and the impact on their other goals.</p><h3 id="The-problem-of-local-optimisations"><a href="#The-problem-of-local-optimisations" class="headerlink" title="The problem of local optimisations"></a>The problem of local optimisations</h3><p>It is unrealistic to expect members of a team to hold a complete model of the business in their heads which they can refer to when making decisions. Teams need the mental space to be able to focus on the domain and part of the system for which they have direct responsibility.</p><p>The downside to this is known as the problem of local optimisations.

But let’s pay attention to a key word I used above. Docker grants <em>isolation</em>. And what do we like to perform on our application in isolation? Yeah, you guessed right &ndash; testing!</p><p>Specifically, with this post, I aim to dig deeper into how to use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-compose</a> (a specific Docker-based tool that enables creation of multi-container Docker applications) to build and run a Node.js application connected to MongoDB, to test their interaction and the interaction of the app with the external world, all inside containers running on your machine. All isolated and testable thanks to the usage of containers that we can spin up, hit with tests, and clean up with little effort. </p><p>Interested? Let’s go!</p><h2 id="Scenario"><a href="#Scenario" class="headerlink" title="Scenario"></a><a name="scenario"></a>Scenario</h2><p>In this scenario we will use Docker and one of its functionalities, docker-compose, to build a container and spin up our app.  Then we build another container with a copy of the database where we can freely create and manipulate data, and finally we perform all the integration testing we want against those self-contained entities, which we can clean up after the tests ran. Total isolation and, very importantly, no need to pollute our development or pre-production environment with superfluous test data.</p><p>Let’s imagine an app that we can build and test, for example a directory of soul music artists.</p><p>Then let’s scope what our app needs to do, and how to test it. Our purpose is to:</p><ul><li>Test that when we hit the <code>/</code> path we get a 200 response and a basic home page.</li><li>Test that we can post a payload against the <code>/artist</code> path, to create one entry in our database (let’s say the great Marvin Gaye).</li><li>Test that when we hit the <code>/artist/marvingaye</code> we get the artist page with its name</li></ul><h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a><a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>Before diving into the prototype we should make sure everything is setup correctly.

We are hitting the ‘real’ app with our request, but this is not what we call isolation, right?</p><p>Now is a good time to pull Docker in. We can use docker-compose to build a container with our app that runs on port 3001, nice and separated from our development one. Let’s do it.</p><p>All we need to do is create a Dockerfile in the root folder:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">FROM node:4-onbuild</span><br><span class="line">EXPOSE 3000</span><br><span class="line">ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/usr/local/bin/node&quot;, &quot;index.js&quot;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Let’s take a look at what this set of instructions mean. We are building a container with our app, taking the base image from the Node.js official image (the environment where the app will run), exposing the port that the app will use for serving requests, and running the server at last. This, by the way, is a pretty standard way of using a Node.js within Docker.</p><p>Now, to spin up the app and hit it with tests, let’s use docker-compose. This will come in useful later, when we will add another container (the database) linked with our app. For now it will run a single container. To do it, all we need to do is create a <a href="https://github.com/federicomaffei/soul-compose/blob/faca99d02178407f3ffa9bfd932bcb8932dfd2e0/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-compose.yml</a> file in our root folder:</p><figure class="highlight yml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">version:</span> <span class="string">'2'</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">services:</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">soul-compose:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">build:</span></span><br><span class="line">      <span class="attr">context:</span> <span class="string">.</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">ports:</span></span><br><span class="line">      <span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="string">"3001:3000"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This is a standard way of adding a service to a docker-compose configuration file. We are declaring that the context of the container is the top folder (where the Dockerfile that will be used to build it lives), and mapping port 3000 of the container to port 3001 of our local environment. This will allow the container to run in parallel with the app running locally, without the risk of having port allocation issues.<br>Now, let’s build and run our one-container composition:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">docker-compose up -d</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The interesting detail here is the -d option: it basically allows the container to run detached from the command line (in background mode, if you wish). This means we can stay on the same terminal and just run the tests again.</p><p>And (making sure we changed our tests to make requests to port 3001) our single test should pass! Now on to bigger things.</p><h5 id="Code-example-at-this-point-2"><a href="#Code-example-at-this-point-2" class="headerlink" title="Code example at this point."></a><a href="https://github.com/federicomaffei/soul-compose/tree/faca99d02178407f3ffa9bfd932bcb8932dfd2e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code example at this point.</a></h5><h3 id="Step-4-New-artist-throw-Mongo-into-the-mix"><a href="#Step-4-New-artist-throw-Mongo-into-the-mix" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: New artist (throw Mongo into the mix)!"></a>Step 4: New artist (throw Mongo into the mix)!</h3><p>So the first acceptance test passes. Now, let’s test a route that allows us to create an entry for a new artist, and test that if we hit an endpoint called <code>/artist</code> with a payload, we get a 200 code from the route. It won’t actually create it for now, but it will give us a path to do the actual creation later.</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">beforeEach(<span class="function">(<span class="params">done</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> options = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        method: <span class="string">'POST'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        uri: <span class="string">'http://localhost:3001/artist'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        body: &#123;

First and foremost, we added an entry for the MongoDB image to be built and run:</p><figure class="highlight yml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">mongodb:</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">image:</span> <span class="string">mongo:3.0.11</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">ports:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="string">"27018:27017"</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">command:</span> <span class="string">--smallfiles</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To make sure that the app and MongoDB load up in the right order (mongo, then app) we can also specify a <em>depends_on</em> property, meaning the app will wait for Mongo to start, and then will be able to access it through the hostname <em>mongodb</em>.</p><figure class="highlight yml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">soul-compose:</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">build:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="attr">context:</span> <span class="string">.</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">ports:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="string">"3001:3000"</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">environment:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="string">NODE_ENV=test</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="attr">depends_on:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="bullet">-</span> <span class="string">mongodb</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This means we will also have to change the code in the app to take that into account. One way to do it is by exporting an environment variable in the application container using docker-compose (as you can see above), and set the MongoDB hostname depending on it <a href="https://github.com/federicomaffei/soul-compose/blob/2962d28e33366a92801f0ef2c18ef3dc7dd9f9db/index.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our index.js file</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At OpenTable, we have an engineering culture that empowers us to research, experiment and learn. </p><p>In an effort to foster innovation and to try new ideas, <a href="/blog/authors/ccartlidge.html">Chris Cartlidge</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickbalestra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nick Balestra</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tpgmartin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Martin</a> and <a href="/blog/authors/mrichetto.html">myself</a> started to work on a side project nicknamed big-mars. Our project is a mobile-first, responsive web application that uses Falcor by Netflix.</p><p>Falcor, a JavaScript library for efficient data fetching, is an implementation of the Backend for Frontend (BFF) or the API Gateway pattern.</p><p>One powerful concept that Falcor has is its query model, in which you access your data as if it was a single JSON model in memory.  You can navigate your data structure the way you would navigate a JSON object; either with a “dot notation” (e.g. restaurant.address.city) or with an “array notation” (e.g. restaurant[‘address’][‘city’]). </p><p>Really easy and intuitive.</p><p>However, while experimenting and learning how to properly use its query model, we noticed that it was quite hard to “visualise” the expected result from the API calls without using, for instance, our beloved in-browser Developer Tools console.</p><h2 id="falcor-postman"><a href="#falcor-postman" class="headerlink" title="falcor-postman"></a>falcor-postman</h2><p>The Falcor project released many additional packages in order to facilitate developers who are willing to use this technology (e.g. falcor-express) but in this ecosystem we noticed a lack of tools with a GUI on top.</p><p>We also noticed that the GraphQL, another project that shares with Falcor the same core concepts, has tools with visual interfaces (e.g. express-graphql and GraphiQL).</p><p>So as a spin-off of our big-mars project, Nick and I decided to build a tool with a nice and intuitive GUI responsible for exercising the Falcor endpoint in order to help us to validate our queries, and we named this tool <a href="https://github.com/opentable/falcor-postman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falcor-postman</a>.</p><p>So we decided to build falcor-postman as an Express.js middleware, making it easy to plug into an existing Falcor project that uses Express.js as a web application framework. We are releasing it as an Open Source Software project so that others can take advantage of it and hopefully speed up their own development lifecycle.</p><h2 id="The-features"><a href="#The-features" class="headerlink" title="The features"></a>The features</h2><p>When plugged into an existing Express.js application it will be possible to access a specific configurable route, showing a web page in which you can write Falcor queries and send them to your Falcor endpoint. Then the result of the query will be presented.</p><p>It will be also possible to resend previous queries and modify them, as they will be saved for you into your browser’s local storage.</p><img src="/images/posts/falcor-postman.png" class="center"><h2 id="Under-the-hood"><a href="#Under-the-hood" class="headerlink" title="Under the hood"></a>Under the hood</h2><p>Falcor-postman is composed by an Express.js middleware responsible for serving the UI which is a React.js application. Webpack is our module bundler. We take advantage of hot reloading in development mode while for the production release we create a physical file containing the bundle.</p><p>In addition we are using <a href="http://purecss.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pure.css</a> and <a href="https://codemirror.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codemirror</a> that are helping us with the UI, and we are also using eslint-config-opentable (another OpenTable open source project) as our .eslintrc config.</p><h2 id="What’s-next"><a href="#What’s-next" class="headerlink" title="What’s next?"></a>What’s next?</h2><p>falcor-postman v2.0.0 has just been released on npm and we’re awaiting feedback. Also, we have some issues in our GitHub repository which we will use to build our own product roadmap.</p><p>In the short term we would like to fix some outstanding minor issues that we are aware of (polishing the UI, enhancing the query history) but in the long term we would also like to enable data update; at the moment, our middleware only enables fetches but we’d like to better reflect the full functionality of Falcor, which allows for updates as well.</p><h2 id="One-final-comment"><a href="#One-final-comment" class="headerlink" title="One final comment"></a>One final comment</h2><p>At OpenTable we love OSS and we truly believe that sharing knowledge and experiences is one of the best ways for learning and growing as engineers. We highly encourage you to reach out to us if you would like to discuss your experience with us or simply would like to understand better what we do.</p><h2 id="Links-and-resources"><a href="#Links-and-resources" class="headerlink" title="Links and resources"></a>Links and resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/opentable/falcor-postman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falcor-postman GitHub repository</a></li><li><a href="https://netflix.github.io/falcor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Falcor website</a></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many engineers work every day on opentable.com from our offices located in Europe, America, and Asia, pushing changes to production multiple times a day. Usually, this is very hard to achieve, in fact it took years for us to get to this point. <a href="/blog/2015/02/09/dismantling-the-monolith-microsites-at-opentable/">I described in a previous article</a> how we dismantled our monolith in favour of a Microsites architecture. Since the publication of that blog post we have been working on something I believe to be quite unique, called <strong>OpenComponents</strong>.</p><h3 id="Another-front-end-framework"><a href="#Another-front-end-framework" class="headerlink" title="Another front-end framework?"></a>Another front-end framework?</h3><p>OpenComponents is a system to facilitate code sharing, reduce dependencies, and easily approach new features and experiments from the back-end to the front-end. To achieve this, it is based on the concept of using services as interfaces - enabling pages to render partial content that is located, executed and deployed independently.</p><p>OpenComponents is not <em>another SPA JS framework</em>; it is a set of conventions, patterns and tools to develop and quickly deploy fragments of front-end. In this perspective, it plays nicely with any existing architecture and framework in terms of front-end and back-end. Its purpose is to <strong>serve as delivery mechanism for a more modularised end-result in the front-end</strong>.</p><p>OC is been in production for more than a year at OpenTable and it is <a href="https://github.com/opentable/oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully open-sourced</a>.</p><h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a>Overview</h2><p>OpenComponents involves two parts:</p><ul><li>The <strong>consumers</strong> are web pages that need fragments of HTML for rendering partial contents. Sometimes they need some content during server-side rendering, somethings when executing code in the browser.</li><li>The <strong>components</strong> are small units of isomorphic code mainly consisting of HTML, Javascript and CSS. They can optionally contain some logic, allowing a server-side Node.js closure to compose a model that is used to render the view. When rendered they are pieces of HTML, ready to be injected in any web page.</li></ul><p>The framework consists of three parts:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cli</strong> allows developers to create, develop, test, and publish components.</li><li>The <strong>library</strong> is where the components are stored after the publishing. When components depend on static resources (such as images, CSS files, etc.) these are stored, during packaging and publishing, in a publicly-exposed part of the library that serves as a CDN.</li><li>The <strong>registry</strong> is a REST API that is used to consume components. It is the entity that handles the traffic between the library and the consumers.</li></ul><p>In the following example, you can see how a web page looks like when including both a server-side rendered component (<em>header</em>) and client-side (still) unrendered component (<em>advert</em>):</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE <span class="meta-keyword">html</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">oc-component</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="string">"//oc-registry.com/header/1.X.X"</span> <span class="attr">data-rendered</span>=<span class="string">"true"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">a</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="string">"/"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">      <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"//cdn.com/oc/header/1.2.3/img/logo.png"</span> /&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">a</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">oc-component</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">p</span>&gt;</span>page content<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">p</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">oc-component</span> <span class="attr">href</span>=<span class="string">"//oc-registry.com/advert/~1.3.5/?type=bottom"</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">oc-component</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"//oc-registry/oc-client/client.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Getting-started"><a href="#Getting-started" class="headerlink" title="Getting started"></a>Getting started</h3><p>The only prerequisite for creating a component is Node.js:</p><figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ npm install -g oc</span><br><span class="line">$ mkdir components &amp;&amp; <span class="built_in">cd</span> components</span><br><span class="line">$ oc init my-component</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Components are folders containing the following files:</p><table style="margin-bottom:16px;"><br>    <tr><br>        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">File</th><br>        <th style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px 10px;border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;">Description</th><br>    </tr><br>    <tr><br>        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight:bold;">package.json</td><br>        <td style="padding:5px 10px;font-weight: inherit;">A common <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json" target="_blank">node’s package.json</a>.

You can render components just on the client-side, just on the server-side, or use the client-side rendering as failover strategy for when the server-side rendering fails (for example because the registry is not responding quickly or it is down).</p><p>You don’t need Node.js to consume components on the server-side. The registry can provide rendered components so that you can consume them using any tech stack.</p><p>When published, components are immutable and semantic versioned. The registry allows consumers to get any version of the component: the latest patch, or minor version, etc. For instance, <code>http://registry.com/component</code> serves the latest version, and <code>http://registry.com/component/^1.2.5</code> serves the most recent major version for v1.</p><h3 id="Client-side-rendering"><a href="#Client-side-rendering" class="headerlink" title="Client-side

These are some of the most powerful features:</p><ul><li>It <strong>enables developers to create and publish components very easily</strong>. None of the operations need any infrastructural work as the framework takes care, when packaging, of making each component <em>production-ready</em>.</li><li>It is <strong>framework agnostic</strong>. Microsites written in <em>C#</em>, <em>Node</em> and <em>Ruby</em> consume components on the server-side via the API. In the front-end, it is great for delivering neutral pieces of HTML but works well for Angular components and React views too.</li><li>It enables <strong>granular ownership</strong>. Many teams can own components and they all are discoverable via the same service.</li><li>Isomorphism is good for <strong>performance</strong>. It enables consumers to render things on the server-side when needed (mobile apps, SEO) and defer to the client-side contents that are not required on the first load (third-party widgets, adverts, SPA fragments).</li><li>Isomorphism is good for <strong>robustness</strong>. When something is going bad on the server-side (the registry is erroring or slow) it is possible to use client-side rendering as a fail-over mechanism. The Node.js client does this by default.</li><li>It is a good approach for <strong>experimentation</strong>. People can work closely to the business to create widgets that are capable of both getting data from back-end services and deliver them via rich UIs. We very often had teams that were able to create and instrument tests created via OC in less then 24 hours.</li><li>Semver and auto-generated documentation <strong>enforce clear contracts</strong>. Consumers can pick the version they want and component owners can keep clear what the contract is.</li><li>A more componentised front-end leads to write <strong>more easily destroyable code</strong>. As opposite of writing highly maintainable code, this approach promotes small iterations on very small, easily readable and testable units of code. In this perspective, recreating something from scratch is perfectly acceptable and recommended, as there is almost zero cost for a developer to start a new project and the infrastructure in place makes maintainance and deprecation as easy as a couple of clicks. </li></ul><p>If you wish to try or know more about OpenComponents, visit <a href="https://github.com/opentable/oc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OC’s github page</a> or have a look at <a href="https://github.com/matteofigus/oc-components-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some component examples</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At OpenTable it’s becoming an increasingly popular trend to use <em><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React</a></em>.<br>One of the reasons for this is the ability for it  to server-side render whilst still<br>giving us the client side flexibility that we all crave!</p><p>We all know to have stable, reliable software you need to have well written tests. Facebook knows this and<br>provides the handy <em><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Utilities</a></em> library to make<br>our lives easier.</p><p>Cool — I hear you all say! But what is the best approach to testing React components?</p><p>Well unfortunately this is something that is not very well documented and if not approached in<br>the correct way can lead to brittle tests.</p><p>Therefore I have written this blog post to discuss the different approaches we have available to us.</p><p>All code used in this post is avaliable on my <em><a href="https://github.com/chriscartlidge/React-Testing-Blog-Code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a></em>.</p><h2 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h2><p>To make our lives a lot easier when writing test it’s best to use a couple of basic tools. Below is<br>the absolute minimum required to start testing React components.</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://mochajs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mocha</a></em> - This is a testing framework that runs in the browser or Node.JS (others are available).</li><li><em><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReactTestUtils</a></em> - This is the basic testing framework that Facebook provides to go testing with React.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Scenario"><a href="#The-Scenario" class="headerlink" title="The Scenario"></a>The Scenario</h2><p>We have a landing page broken down into two separate components:</p><ul><li>Container - The holding container for all sub-components.</li><li>Menu Bar - Contains the site navigation and is always displayed.</li></ul><p><img src="/images/posts/react-comp.png" alt="react-comp"></p><p>Each React component is self-contained and should be tested in isolation.</p><p>For the purpose of this exercise we will focus on the test for the container component and<br>making sure that the menu bar is displayed within it.</p><h2 id="Approach-1-Full-DOM"><a href="#Approach-1-Full-DOM" class="headerlink" title="Approach 1 (Full DOM):"></a>Approach 1 (Full DOM):</h2><p>I like to call this the “Full DOM” approach because you take a component and render it in its entirety<br>including all of its children.

Probably not as it still lacking on key feature for me when dealing<br>with large components and that is the ability to easily query the ReactDOM (libraries like <em><a href="https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enzyme</a></em><br>are working towards improving this). But it is still a lot better than rendering the component out into HTML and coupling your tests<br>to the inner components of others.</p><p>In this blog post we have just scratched the surface of testing with React and I hope it’s food for thought when writing your next set of<br>React tests.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Puppet is an important tool to us at OpenTable; we couldn’t operate as efficiently without it but Puppet is more than a tool or a vendor, it is a community of people trying to help<br>each other operate increasing complex and sophisticated infrastructures.</p><p>The Puppet community and the open source efforts that drive that community have always been important to us which is why we want to take a step further in our efforts and introduce<br>you to the “Puppet-community” project.</p><h2 id="What-is-Puppet-community"><a href="#What-is-Puppet-community" class="headerlink" title="What is Puppet-community"></a>What is Puppet-community</h2><p>Puppet-community is a GitHub organisation of like-minded individuals from across the wider Puppet ecosystem and from a diverse set of companies. Its principle aims are to allow the community to synchronise its efforts and to provide a GitHub organisation and Puppet Forge namespace not affiliated with any company.</p><p>Its wider aims are to provide a place for module and tool authors to share their code and the burden of maintaining it.</p><p>I would like to say that this was our idea, as it’s an excellent one, but actually all credit goes to its founders: <a href="https://github.com/igalic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Igor Galić</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daenney" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniele Sluijters</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nibalizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spencer Krum</a></p><h2 id="Why-communities-matter"><a href="#Why-communities-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why communities matter"></a>Why communities matter</h2><p>So why all the fuss about this? Why does it even matter where your code lives?</p><p>Well these are the some questions that I asked myself when I first heard about this project at PuppetConf 2014. The answer is that is really does matter and it’s a pattern that is<br>developing elsewhere (see: <a href="https://github.com/packer-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">packer-community</a>, <a href="https://github.com/terraform-community-modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">terraform-community-modules</a>,<br><a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloudfoundry-community</a>) to deal with the problems you’ll face with a large amount of open source code.</p><p>Stepping back slightly, if you look at open source then there are three types: product-based (think open-core), corporate/individual sponsored,  and community-driven.</p><p>The first is common for businesses (like PuppetLabs) who’s product is a open source product. They make great efforts to build a community, fix bugs and accept changes. They make  their money through extras (add-ons and/or professional services). They control what they will/won’t accept and are driven by the need to build that community as well as support those big paying customers who pay the bills - it’s a tough balancing act.</p><p>The second is what you probably mean when you think about open source. It’s a individual or company that dumps some code they have been working on to GitHub and that’s it - they own it, they control it, it they don’t like your changes they don’t even have to give a reason. They can also choose to close or delete the project whenever they want or more likely they will just let it sit on GitHub and move onto the next thing.</p><p>The third is the community approach. Create a GitHub organisation, move your projects and add some new people in there with commit access. This is a different approach because it means<br>that you don’t own it any more, you don’t have that tight control over the codebase because there are other people with other opinions that you have to take into account. It also means<br>that on long weeks when you’re on-call or on holiday that there is someone else to pick up the slack and merge those pull requests for you. It has massive benefits if you can keep that<br>ego in check.</p><h2 id="Why-we’re-moving-our-modules-there"><a href="#Why-we’re-moving-our-modules-there" class="headerlink" title="Why we’re moving our modules there"></a>Why we’re moving our modules there</h2><p>So why is OpenTable moving its modules there? It is because we care about the community (particularly those using Puppet on Windows) and want to make sure there is good long term<br>support for the modules that we authored. OpenTable isn’t a company that authors Puppet modules, it is a company that seats diners in restaurants so from time to time we are going<br>to work on other things.</p><p>By being part of the community there will be other people who can help discuss and diagnose bugs, merge pull requests and generally help with any problems that arise when using<br>the modules we created.</p><p>Sometimes when writing a module it’s not about being the best, sometimes it’s just about being first - we got a bit lucky. What that means though is that we need to recognise that there<br>are plenty of people out there in the community that have better knowledge than us about a tool or application and might be better suited to guide the project forward - heck we might<br>even learn from them in the process.</p><p>So let’s lose our egos, loosen that grip and let those modules be free …</p><h2 id="What-that-means-for-you"><a href="#What-that-means-for-you" class="headerlink" title="What that means for you"></a>What that means for you</h2><p>Ok, so let’s get practical for a second. What’s happening here? What our support of Puppet-community means is that our code has moved into a new organisation<br>(<a href="https://github.com/puppet-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/puppet-community</a>) and our modules have been re-released under the community namespace on the forge<br>(<a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet</a>). So if you are using our modules then you should go and have a look on the forge and update to the latest versions.<br>We will continue to provide lots of support to these modules but so will lots of others (including some PuppetLabs employees) so expect the quality of the modules to also start increasing.</p><p>If you have any thoughts or questions about this you can reach out to me personally on twitter: <a href="twitter.com/liamjbennett">@liamjbennett</a> or via email at: <a href="mailto:liamjbennett@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liamjbennett@gmail.com</a></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction-to-DNS"><a href="#Introduction-to-DNS" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to DNS"></a>Introduction to DNS</h2><p>Before joining OpenTable I was looking for a software engineer job and I’ve done my fair share of interviews. A question that has popped out a lot, and when I say a lot I mean <em>always</em>, is:</p><p><em>Could you tell me what happens when I type an URL in a web browser on my computer and press enter?</em></p><p>Of course the possible answers could range from “MMMHHH, wellll, I’m not sure where to start…” to a whole book on computer networks.</p><p>After a number of attempts to answer briefly and correctly, I’ve concluded that mentioning <strong>DNS</strong> can make a reasonable start.</p><p>Let’s think about it. When we type the address of the resource we want to browse, we use the alphabet, right? With letters and names easily readable and retainable by a human being.</p><p>But a machine needs an <strong>IP address</strong> to recognize another machine connected to a network. An IP address is numerical, for example 192.168.0.1. Less readable, it seems.</p><p>And here is where DNS comes to play. DNS stands for <strong>Domain Name System</strong>, and that represents exactly what it is: a system that translates <strong>domain names</strong> (e.g <em><a href="http://www.opentable.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.opentable.co.uk</a></em>), into IP addresses. I think of it as a phone book. It is queried with a domain name and, after a lookup, returns an IP.</p><p>How does the magic happen? Let’s look into it.</p><h2 id="The-ABC"><a href="#The-ABC" class="headerlink" title="The ABC"></a>The ABC</h2><h3 id="Some-definitions"><a href="#Some-definitions" class="headerlink" title="Some definitions"></a>Some definitions</h3><p>So we can define a domain name as a string composed by one or more parts, called <strong>labels</strong>, concatenated and delimited by dots with a <strong>hierarchical</strong> logic.</p><p>In the case of <a href="http://www.opentable.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.opentable.co.uk</a>, for instance, we have four labels:</p><ul><li><p><em>uk</em> is the <strong>top-level</strong> domain. This should sound familiar. Famous top-level domains are also <em>.net</em>, <em>.org</em>, <em>.uk</em>, <em>.it</em>, <em>.gov</em>, etc.</p></li><li><p><em>co</em> is the <strong>second level</strong> domain, which in this case specifies the commercial nature of the company.</p></li><li><p>Hierarchy goes from right to left, so then we can say that <em>opentable</em> is a <strong>subdomain</strong> of <em>co</em>. And so on.</p></li><li><p>A name that can be associated to a specific machine connected to a network with an IP address is called <strong>hostname</strong>. Let’s say it’s the leftmost label in the domain name.</p></li></ul><h3 id="Questions-that-pop-out-at-this-point"><a href="#Questions-that-pop-out-at-this-point" class="headerlink" title="Questions that pop out at this point"></a>Questions that pop out at this point</h3><p>Q: So all the host names reachable via a specific domain have a specific IP address! There must be BILLIONS of them. How do we make sure everyone is unique?</p><p>A: There are entities that have the authority to assign and register names under one or more top-level domain, called <strong>registrars</strong>. The registered name then becomes part of a central database known as the <em>whois database</em>.</p><p>Q: Now, how do we retrieve this infamous IP address by just knowing a domain name? Who can <strong>resolve</strong> this request?</p><p>A: Well, the domain name is resolved into an IP address by querying <strong>authoritative name servers</strong>. These machines are the endpoints of a database that can map domain names to IPs. The authoritative name servers of the top level domain are also called <a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>root level servers</strong></a>.</p><p>Q: OK, but wait a second. How in the heavens does my machine know the address of the name server to query? I thought I just entered an address in the browser!</p><p>A: Every client machine has a default <strong>DNS resolver</strong>, which is responsible of initiating the sequence of queries that will ultimately lead to the resolution.<br>It is very important to note that the system’s DNS setting can be also overridden by the <a href="http://www.ispreview.co.uk/list.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Internet Service Provider</strong></a> (ISP) settings, so the DNS lookup process can be very OS-specific and ISP-specific. This would deserve a whole post apart.</p><h3 id="How-to-resolve-an-address-ideally"><a href="#How-to-resolve-an-address-ideally" class="headerlink" title="How to resolve an address (ideally)"></a>How to resolve an address (ideally)</h3><p>Resolving an address via DNS is also called <strong>lookup</strong>, and it is a recursive process. Now that we know the purpose of DNS, and the concepts involved in the process, we can dig a little deeper into its basic mechanism, which is roughly:</p><ol><li><p>The resolver has knowledge of the addresses of root name servers, from where the search can start.</p></li><li><p>The root name server will return a name server which is authoritative for the top-level domain.</p></li><li><p>This server will give the address of the name server authoritative for the second level domain.</p></li><li><p>If the hostname is resolved, an IP address is returned. Otherwise step 3) is repeated for all the labels of the domain name in sequence, until a result is reached.</p></li></ol><p>I made a diagram that shows that.</p><p><img src="http://federicomaffei.github.io/public/images/dnsbasic.jpg" class="center-image"></p><h3 id="Real-life-problems"><a href="#Real-life-problems" class="headerlink" title="Real life problems"></a>Real life problems</h3><p>The mechanism explained above is great, but if applied in a real life application, it will lead to a bottleneck. Every lookup would involve root servers and authoritative servers, which would be hit by gazillions of queries every day, putting a huge burden on the system since the start.</p><p>To solve this, of course a <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/blog/dns-cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>caching</strong></a> system comes to help. Yes, DNS allows and encourages caching. This way another class of DNS servers comes into play, the <strong>recursive name servers</strong>. They can perform recursive lookups and cache results, returning them when queried even if they don’t have the authority to generate the results themselves.</p><p>Caching recursive DNS server are usually managed by Internet Service Providers, and are able to resolve addresses without waiting for the “authorities”. This means that a query will rarely have to hit the root name servers, since there is a very high likelihood that the hostname/IP request is already cached by one of the delegated DNS servers that are called by recursion.</p><p>We could say that in reality a root server will be hit as a last resort to track down an authoritative server for a given domain.</p><p>The amount of time for which a lookup result is stored on a server is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>time-to-live (TTL)</strong></a> and can vary with the configuration.</p><p>One side effect of the heavy caching that involves the DNS is that when a new domain is registered, or there is a change in any domain-related settings, there will be a time lag for the propagation of it to all the cached results.</p><p>It is noteworthy that cached DNS results from your browsing could be stored in your router, or somewhere within you browser memory as well. These IP addresses seem to be everywhere these days!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I barely scratched the surface of the Domain Name System topic, and that alone took a good day of research and writing.</p><p>So I decided to avoid making this post too long, so that beginners that are going to find it will profit, and be encouraged to research on these key concepts. This will allow me to decide which part of DNS is worth more digging, and maybe write a sequel. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we first stood up our hapi.js APIs, we wrote init scripts to start/stop them. Stopping the server, was simply a case of sending SIGKILL (causing the app to immediately exit).</p><p>Whilst this is fine for most cases, if we want our apps to be good Linux citizens, then they should terminate gracefully. Hapi.js has the handy <code>server.stop(...)</code> command (see docs <a href="http://hapijs.com/api#serverstopoptions-callback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) which will terminate the server gracefully. It will cause the server to respond to new connections with a 503 (server unavailable), and wait for existing connections to terminate (up to some specified timeout), before stopping the server and allowing the node.js process to exit. Perfect.</p><p>This makes our graceful shutdown code really simple:</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">process.on(<span class="string">'SIGTERM'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  server.stop(&#123; <span class="attr">timeout</span>: <span class="number">5</span> * <span class="number">1000</span>&#125;, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    process.exit(<span class="number">0</span>);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>When we see a SIGTERM, call <code>server.stop()</code>, then once the server has stopped, call <code>process.exit(0)</code>.

In our case, that isn’t particularly desirable. We use service-discovery, which means that the graceful termination of our app should run like this:</p><ul><li>SIGTERM</li><li>Unannounce from Service-Discovery</li><li><code>server.stop(...)</code></li><li><code>process.exit(0)</code></li></ul><p>Ideally we want the unannounce to happen before the server starts rejecting connections, in order to reduce the likelihood that clients will hit a server that is shutting down.</p><h3 id="Plugins-to-the-rescue"><a href="#Plugins-to-the-rescue" class="headerlink" title="Plugins to the rescue!"></a>Plugins to the rescue!</h3><p>Thanks to hapi.js’s awesome plugin interface (<a href="http://t.co/GDw44SETfS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shameless self promotion</a>), we can do some magic to make the above possible.</p><p>I created a really simple plugin called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hapi-shutdown</a> which will handle SIGTERM and then run triggers before calling <code>server.stop(...)</code>.</p><p>The idea is that it allows us to run the ‘unannounce’ step, before <code>server.stop(...)</code> is called.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-hapi-shutdown"><a href="#How-to-use-hapi-shutdown" class="headerlink" title="How to use hapi-shutdown"></a>How to use hapi-shutdown</h3><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">server.register([</span><br><span class="line">  &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    plugin: <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">'hapi-shutdown'</span>),</span><br><span class="line">    options: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      serverSpindownTime: <span class="number">5000</span> <span class="comment">// the timeout passed to server.stop(...)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;],</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">err</span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    server.start(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">      server.plugins[<span class="string">'hapi-shutdown'</span>].register(&#123;</span><br><span class="line">        taskname: <span class="string">'do stuff'</span>,</span><br><span class="line">        task: <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">done</span>)</span>&#123; </span><br><span class="line">          <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="string">'doing stuff before server.stop is called'</span>); </span><br><span class="line">          done(); </span><br><span class="line">        &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">        timeout: <span class="number">2000</span> <span class="comment">// time to wait before forcibly returning</span></span><br><span class="line">      &#125;)</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The plugin exposes a <code>.register()</code> function which allows you to register your shutdown tasks.
